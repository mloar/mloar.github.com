SDOT has just announced an open house for the Belltown-Uptown Transit Improvement Project on **August 21st** from **4-6 PM** at the **Urban Oasis Cafe, 2929 1st Avenue**.

Following the Broad Street BAT lane which was installed a few months ago, this round of improvements includes new trolley wire on Denny Way between 1st and 3rd for eastbound buses, so that southbound 1, 2, and 13 buses can skip the dog-leg on 1st and Broad with its attendant unprotected left turn.

Excitingly, this project would also eliminate the terribly substandard stop at Warren and Denny in favor of a new stop just west of 2nd Avenue next to the Cisco building. This new stop would also have a shelter. I contacted SDOT and they confirmed that Metro will close the stop at 3rd and Broad (in the triangular parklet) and the 8 will serve this new stop.

Construction is planned for Fall, with Metro switching over as part of the February service change.
