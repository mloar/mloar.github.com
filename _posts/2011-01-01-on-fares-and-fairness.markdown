A few weeks ago a dear friend and car-free comrade posted this on Facebook:

While I suggested to her that emailing her representative on the county council might be a more productive way of protesting the latest fare increase, I understand her frustration.  This morning, Metro will ring in the new year with its fourth fare hike in four years.  While it could be argued they are making up for lost time (fares remained static from 2001 to 2007, while costs such as the cost of diesel rose dramatically during this period), it presents some interesting problems, as seen on this graph:

![](../../../image/2010/12/18749161-Fare_History.png)


Back in 2007, ST Express bus fares were appropriately set as a premium to Metro service.  The ST Express 1-zone fare was equal to the Metro 1-zone peak fare, and the 2-zone fare was a full 50 cents greater than Metro's highest fare.  This is logical considering that ST Express is, as its name suggests, a purely express service.  ST Express buses largely operate on freeways and have long stop spacing, which reduce travel time.  Many other cities, such as [Boston][0], have higher fares for express buses.  Express buses generally attract commuters, who tend to be less price-sensitive than bus riders at large, and as the old adage goes, "Time is money."  Many people are willing to spend a little more money if it gets them where they're going faster.



But let's look at the other end of the graph.  As of today, Metro's highest fare is $3, while Sound Transit's is $2.50\.  This presents some interesting contrasts.  Say I'm in downtown Seattle, it's 8 AM, and I want to go to Redmond.  That's easy: take ST Express route 545\.  Cost: $2.50\.  Perhaps I want to go to Bellevue instead.  Also easy: take ST Express route 550\.  Cost: $2.50\.  But what if I want to go to Kirkland?  Then I have to take Metro route 255\.  Cost: **$3.00**.  There's no significant difference in distance, and the 255 runs express between downtown and the Eastside just like the ST Express routes, but it costs 50 cents more simply because the bus is the wrong color.



Sound Transit is also adjusting their fare structure come June, but the problem I just described will persist.   Another temporary problem, however, involves 1-zone fares.  Say I'm in Lake City, at NE 125th St and Lake City Way, and I want to go downtown.  I have several options.  I can take the 41, which runs local to Northgate before running express on I-5 to downtown.  Or I can take the 72, which runs local to the U-District and depending on the time of day runs local through Eastlake or express to downtown.  Or I can take the 522, which makes no stops between my current location and downtown Seattle, running via I-5\.



What is the cost?  For either the 41 or the 72, $2.25 or $2.50, depending on the time of day.  But for the 522, $2.00\.  As I said, this problem goes away once Sound Transit adjusts their fares in June, but it's still pretty silly that the fastest trip downtown is also the cheapest.



However, this has not gone unnoticed by Metro.  Six months ago Metro issued a [report][1] on regional fare coordination which highlighted these issues.  But I disagree with their recommendations.  On page 16, all of the scenarios eliminate the zone surcharge, but only one suggests eliminating the peak surcharge (and setting the higher of the fares, $2.50, as the fare for all trips on Metro).  But I think this is wrong.



The rationale behind the peak surcharge is understandable.  For any transit agency, the most expensive service is peak service.  You have to size your fleet to handle peak, which means a significant number of buses sit idle at the base for most of the day.  At least in Metro's case, you have to hire a lot of part-time operators who are benefits-eligible, meaning that hiring another operator costs more than just the wage for the 2.5 hours of work they are promised per day.

But if we want fares to reflect the cost of service, we need to look at more than just peak.  Looking at the [2009 Route Performance Report][2] makes it clear that Eastside service is more expensive.  Seattle buses on average pay 32.8% of their operations costs out of the farebox.  But for the Eastside, it's a dismal 16.9%, about half.  If Metro really wanted fares to reflect the cost of service, there should be a surcharge for Eastside routes.



But my argument is that Metro focuses too much on peak.  This is made apparent in the [final report][3] of the Regional Transit Task Force, which shows that over 40 percent of Metro's routes are classified as "Peak Commuter" routes, while carrying fewer riders per platform hour than even "Local" routes which operate no more than every 30 minutes throughout the day.



For illustration, let's look at Metro route [111][4].  This is one of the prototypical peak commuter routes that makes a few trips into Seattle in the morning and a few trips out of Seattle in the evening with no midday, evening or weekend service.  It serves a low-density affluent suburb, and the 111 is the **only** bus route that serves this area.  Thus, living in this area is pretty much impossible unless you own an automobile.  It should then come as no surprise that according to the route performance report, the 111 provides only 34.2 rides per revenue hour (the average for routes in Seattle is 56.8) and recovers only 18% of its operating cost from fares (as I stated earlier, the average for Seattle routes is 32.8%).



I posit that if an area does not warrant all-day bus service, that area does not warrant bus service at all.  Suppose you lived in the area served by the 111, and you worked in downtown Seattle, so you ride the 111 to work in the morning.  What if your child's school called in the middle of the day to say that your child was sick?  What if there is a crisis at work and you have to stay late?  In either of these cases public transit would fail you.  You can bet that the people who are actually in this position have considered the same things and likely came to the conclusion that the inflexibility of a peak commuter route made it an impractical replacement for driving.  A much more useful model would be to have frequent service connecting downtown to Park-and-Rides in the suburbs.  This serves the goal of reducing vehicle-miles-traveled and reducing the number of cars entering the CBD while providing a more flexible and useful commuting option for suburban residents.



A lot of this is a result of the short-sighted, parochial system of 40/40/20, which aims to "correct" the fact that Seattle receives over 60% of bus service hours while supplying only about a third of sales tax revenue by directing more service hours to the east and south.  Of course, Seattle taxpayers also pay for the county to maintain roads in unincorporated areas, which by definition are not in Seattle.  Thanks to the King County Flood Protection District, Seattle taxpayers also subsidize flood control in outlying areas of King County.  These realities make me loathe to shed a tear that the suburbs subsidize bus service in Seattle, where people actually **ride** the buses, and a car-free lifestyle is actually possible.  Thankfully, the RTTF realized this and put together a proposal for service cuts with a strong focus on productivity.



Let me finally pull this together into a concrete proposal:

    
1.  **Eliminate the peak surcharge**. Set the two-zone fare at $2.50, which provides parity with ST Express.  Set the one-zone fare at either $2.00 or $2.25\.
1.  **Provide more consistent service throughout the day**.  Cut routes that only operate during peak and instead focus on providing all-day service to areas that warrant it.
1.  **Create two classes of routes**.  As I see it, there should only be one fareset for a particular route.  As it is, the operator has no real way to tell if a person who asked for a 1-zone fare (or had it automatically done via ORCA preset) actually traveled exclusively in 1 zone.  I think that Metro should have express service providing long-haul service between Park-and-Rides, Transit Centers, and downtown Seattle and local service connecting neighborhoods with sufficient density to these Park-and-Rides and Transit Centers.  The former class would be essentially the same as ST Express and have the same fare considering that Metro routes would only operate within King County.
