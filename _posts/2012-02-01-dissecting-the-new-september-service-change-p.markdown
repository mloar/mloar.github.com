Today Metro [released][3] an updated proposal for the September restructuring associated with the start of RapidRide C & D. The headline change is that they're deferring changes to the 26, 28X, 31, and 355X until the opening of RapidRide E, a sensible move. Notably, the Queen Anne-Madrona restructure that Bruce Nourish of the Seattle Transit Blog has written about a [couple][4] [times][5] remains intact. However, in response to concerns about the loss of service on 6th Ave W, Metro has apparently done what an STB commenter [suggested][6]:

>

> Concerning West Queen Anne service, why not extend Route 1 to serve 6th Ave W and Queen Anne Ave and terminate at the current Route 3 terminal? People on 6th Ave would still have some service and could transfer during off peak times to either route at Queen Anne Ave/Boston St. It would also provide a one-seat ride for 6th Ave W residents to downtown Queen Anne.

However it looks like that comes at a price for Kinnear residents, as the [proposal][0] would reduce off-peak frequency to 30 minutes and night frequency to 30-60 minutes, from current levels of 20 minutes mid-day and half-hourly until midnight.

Other changes:

    
*   Route 5 would continue to operate on Aurora instead of moving to Dexter.
*   The 15X would be preserved to prevent overcrowding on the D Line during peak.
*   The 16 would be use a more direct routing to Northgate via North Seattle Community College.
*   The new Route 18 would continue to First Hill via Yesler Way.
*   New Route 40 has been renumbered Route 20 and would continue to the Admiral District, but would no longer have weekend service.
*   All-day service to Colman Park would be preserved on the 27, but the 27 would use Boren Avenue and Seneca/Spring to downtown instead of Yesler. **This makes no sense.**
*   Route 30 is off the chopping block, but would be truncated to only operate between the UW and Sand Point.
*   Route 33 would be interlined with the new incomprehensible Route 27 so that buses continue to turn off 3rd Avenue and get stuck in freeway traffic.
*   New Route 32 would use Stone Way instead of Wallingford Ave N, and W Mercer Place instead of Harrison in Uptown.
*   Route 37 saved from the chopping block with 4 morning and 4 afternoon peak trips.
*   Reduce peak frequency on the new Route 50 to 20-30 minutes.
*   Retain peak-hour trips on the 55 to prevent overcrowding on the C Line.
*   Make the 56X more express by travelling directly from Admiral Way to the West Seattle Freeway, skipping Chelan Ave SW.
*   No added service on Route 120\.
*   Route 125 would continue to use the Viaduct instead of serving SODO, and would terminate at Westwood Village instead of backtracking to Alaska Junction.
*   Route 128 would continue to double back on itself to serve South Seattle Community College instead of continuing to Alaska Junction via SW Genesee Street.
    



In many cases this constitutes a watering-down of the ambitious original proposal. But in light of the [histrionics][1] on the King County Council on Monday over one lousy bus route, getting these changes approved will still remain an uphill battle.
