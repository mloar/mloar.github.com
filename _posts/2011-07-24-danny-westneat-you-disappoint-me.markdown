He tells the tale of John Littel, a carpenter from West Seattle who sat on the CTAC III committee making a recommendation to the Seattle City Council on the vehicle license fee that they may ask the voters to approve in addition to the $20 VLF already imposed without a public vote. The final [recommendation][0], made a week ago, calls for the full $80 fee authorized by statute, to be divided "30 percent for system preservation and safety, 50 percent for transit improvements and 20 percent for pedestrian and bicycle improvements."

When I learned of this recommendation a few days ago, I was surprised and uneasy. The $20 VLF for the Seattle Transportation Benefit District is already being collected. Metro's only hope of staving off disastrous cuts is another $20 VLF. To have talk of an $80 VLF while the question of saving Metro service is still open seems like terrible timing in my opinion.

Westneat continues to describe the disastrous effect the recession has had on the carpentry industry. He then contrasts that with the burgeoning employment at Amazon's headquarters in South Lake Union. To look at the situation where a carpenters, through no fault of their own, find themselves out of work and struggle to support their families while pimply-faced youth make a king's ransom banging on a keyboard all day and say, "This isn't fair," is perfectly understandable. It's not fair.

But then Westneat makes a dubious connection. "But this is way too much money at the wrong time for stuff that's hardly a top priority. The feds have crippling war debts. The state just cut people off health care and laid off teachers. Now Seattle's going to raise taxes for things like bike lanes, transit planning and traffic calming?"

"Seattle's no middle-class town anymore. Maybe a hundred bucks a car will be greeted with a shrug. Maybe the crowds of young creative-class workers pouring out of Amazon just want the bike lanes, and are willing to pay for them."

Damn those Amazon yuppies with their bike lanes! It's all their fault! It is quite a historical irony that what was a century ago a "rich man's toy" is now the mode of transport of the working class while the lowly bicycle is apparently the exclusive domain of the rich, educated elite. I live in Belltown, and one thing that has struck me when walking the streets late at night is the number of bicyclists I see. Who are these people who are willing to share the streets with drunk drivers and the [world's finest][1] [taxi drivers][2]? Are they Amazon yuppies pedaling home from the sushi bar? Perhaps, but I find it more likely they work in the foodservice or retail industries, heading home after a long evening shift. (I'd ask them, but trying to take a survey of passing bicyclists at 1 AM would be a little weird, even for Belltown.)

Let's take a closer look at the funding plan. Along with their letter of recommendation the CTAC III submitted a [spreadsheet][3] that specifies in greater detail how much funding should be dedicated to each program. The "Bicycle Safety and Access" program is allotted less than 7% of the total. This might explain why the Cascade Bicycle Club (of which I am a member) is already advocating to increase the share for bicycles. The lion's share goes to the "Transit Corridor Improvements" program, which aims to provide speed and reliability enhancements for Seattle's transit service. By increasing the speed and reliability of transit service, you not only provide greater satisfaction to transit riders and provide a more attractive alternative to driving, you make transit more cost-effective. Conversely, when you let buses get stuck in traffic through failure to give them priority, you squander the taxpayers' money.

I have no doubt that should this $80 VLF be passed, it will be a strain on some working families. But a great many working families also depend on Metro bus service, as was clear from the many people who packed hearings to press the County Council to adopt the $20 fee. We must remember that that fee comes with an expiration date in 2014\. Those two years need to be spent finding ways to make Metro service more cost-efficient while also making it work for more of Seattle's hardworking families.

Another interesting item in the committee's recommendation letter is the recommendation that the Freight Master Plan be completed using funding from the transit category. The efficient movement of freight over our city's roadways is important to many blue-collar industries.

Ultimately it's up the City Council (well, technically the Board of the Seattle Transportation Benefit District, but it's the same people) to decide how much to ask voters for, how much to spend on each program, or even whether to wait until later to go to the voters. I'm not going to advocate for any position. But it needs to be clear that this is about a lot more than bike lanes. It's about building a transportation system that works for everyone, and it's doing so not by additional regressive sales taxes, but by a tax on the vehicles that fill our streets.
