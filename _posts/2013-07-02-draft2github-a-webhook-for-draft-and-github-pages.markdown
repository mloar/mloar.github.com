Lately I've starting using [Draft](http://draftin.com), a neat Markdown-based online text editor with built-in versioning by [Nate Kontny](https://twitter.com/natekontny).

Recently he added WebHooks support for publishing to places not natively supported. I recently moved my blog to GitHub Pages, and I thought, "Wouldn't it be cool to publish directly from Draft?"

A few hours later, I have [draft2github](https://npmjs.org/package/draft2github), a Node.js-based WebHook server to do just that. This post was published using it - hopefully the first of many in the near future.
