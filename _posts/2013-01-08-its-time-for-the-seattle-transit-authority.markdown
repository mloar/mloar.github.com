What's that, you ask? RCW 35.95A is the statute that allows cities to form "city transportation authorities" to provide a "public monorail transportation function." It was created back when some well-intentioned citizen activism resulted in the creation of a body with broad taxing authority to provide public transportation service, but limited to a single, impractical technology with which to do it.

The old Seattle Popular Monorail Authority is long gone, but the law that permitted it to be created remains on the books, beckoning transit advocates with the sole remaining Motor Vehicle Excise Tax authority in the state, as well as a generous limit for regular property tax levies, excess levy authority, vehicle license fee authority, and sales tax on rental cars.
