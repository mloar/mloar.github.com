A commenter suggested this problem wouldn't exist if RapidRide did not serve Uptown and instead remained on Elliott to Denny. I agreed and suggested the service hours saved could be used to increase frequency on the new Route 32 which would connect Uptown to the RapidRide stop at 15th & Dravus.

The comment thread was swiftly deleted as being off-topic which led to a hullabaloo on Twitter when I hyperbolically described the STB comment policy as "fascist." Later, Mr. Nourish promised, as is his idiom, to "disembowel" the argument against the Uptown deviation as soon as he receives stop-level ridership data from Metro.

I look forward to his excellent analysis, as always. But here's the thing: he's right. The purpose of RapidRide isn't just to give commuters an express trip into the downtown core. It's to connect the various housing, employment, and activity centers in the city with frequent all-day transit service. RapidRide D skipping Uptown would be as absurd as RapidRide C skipping Pioneer Square or the Stadium District.

Whoops!

RapidRide C operates express between downtown and West Seattle. This fact was apparently lost on Dow Constantine during the press conference about the recent arena proposal, when he called out RapidRide as a good reason to site a new arena in SODO. Sure, Dow, those busses _whizzing by on the Viaduct _will do sports fans a ton of good. But what are you going to to do? It's not like there's a road in SODO reserved for buses or anything. Though to be fair, since SDOT has never seen a need to build an on-ramp to the Spokane Street Viaduct east of the BNSF mainline, using the E-3 busway would subject West Seattle buses to delays at grade crossings.

Furthermore, the two lines are through-routed, meaning that unreliability from a forced late merge on the Ballard Bridge and the aforementioned signal at Elliott & Mercer will affect not just counter-commuters but also folks heading home to West Seattle.
