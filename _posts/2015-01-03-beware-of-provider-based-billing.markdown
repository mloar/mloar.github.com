As a type I diabetic for more than 20 years, one of the first things I did after moving back to Champaign, Illinois to study law was to look for an endocrinologist to take over my care. I looked at the provider directory for my insurance and found a host of endocrinologists associated with "Carle Physician Group." I knew there was a Carle Hospital in Urbana, and figured that these doctors were somehow associated with them. I obtained a referral from a GP at the student health clinic and reported to a [strip mall clinic next to Jimmy John's](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.0979176,-88.2764905,3a,75y,253.79h,83.27t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sZOyCzgq2FQUalQu4m8SuTA!2e0) for my appointment, believing I would have to pay a $60 "Specialist Office Visit" co-pay.

**Nope.**

As I was checking out after my appointment, I noticed a little sign announcing Carle's transition to something called "Provider-Based Billing." Sure enough, a few days later I got an Explanation of Benefits stating that my share of the cost would be over two hundred dollars.

You see, even though my appointment was in a standard office environment  enhanced by the aroma of gourmet sandwiches, for billing purposes, it was an outpatient department of the [hospital](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Carle+Foundation+Hospital,+West+Park+Street,+Urbana,+IL/1813+W+Kirby+Ave,+Champaign,+IL+61821/@40.1074231,-88.2646334,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x880cd771775e3fdf:0xa2c99a72f917731!2m2!1d-88.215059!2d40.11696!1m5!1m1!1s0x880cd0fb9f9d013b:0xdb14022d2971fda5!2m2!1d-88.2773003!2d40.0973964) 4.5 miles away. As such, patients are billed not once for an office visit with a doctor, but twice for both the doctor and for the "hospital" facility, with all its expensive specialized equipment like digital weight scales.

Carle [claims](http://www.carle.org/Billing/Provider-Based-Billing-FAQ.aspx) provider-based billing is "a national model of practice for integrated healthcare delivery systems" and that
> Carle is taking proactive steps to ensure high-quality care is available to the residents of east central Illinois now and in the future. By converting to the provider-based model, Carle is ensuring it is reimbursed fairly for services it provides.

However, the American College of Physicians has [opposed](http://www.acponline.org/acp_policy/policies/provider_based_billing_2013.pdf) the shift to provider-based billing, stating
> The College does not support provider based billing for care delivered in an outpatient, hospital-system owned practice when that care is not dependent on the hospital facility and its associated technologies.

and

> Provider based billing should not be used as a mechanism for hospitals to
recoup/stabilize funding or as a means of ensuring access to care. Ensuring
adequate hospital funding and patientsâ€™ access to care can better be addressed and supported through other means, such as increased/improved health insurance coverage, strengthened workforce policies, and delivery system reforms.

Carle has already [caused an uproar](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2014-05-05/tax-implications-ui-carle-venture-concern-urbana.html) in the community by taking advantage of an 2012 law giving them a break on property taxes, pushing more of the burden on Urbana homeowners. The value of the exemption may grow if plans to build a College of Medicine at the University of Illinois in partnership with Carle are realized.

So word to the wise: if you're planning a doctor visit and have any cause to suspect that the practice may be owned by a hospital system, ask if they practice provider-based billing first. Your wallet will thank you.
