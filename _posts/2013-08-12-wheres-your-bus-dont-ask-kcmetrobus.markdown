Today was a frightful day for everyone who rides Metro buses, and I wish the operator involved a speedy recovery.

But today is just the latest example of King County Metro's egregious disregard for effective communication with riders about disruptions to transit service. The incident happened around 9:20 AM, but the first mention of it on Metro's Twitter feed wasn't until 11:58 AM:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We are working closely w/ <a href="https://twitter.com/SeattlePD">@SeattlePD</a> following today&#39;s shooting. They are the lead &amp; have most accurate info here: <a href="http://t.co/PjwdWqQkAd">http://t.co/PjwdWqQkAd</a></p>&mdash; King County Metro (@kcmetrobus) <a href="https://twitter.com/kcmetrobus/statuses/366997095447662592">August 12, 2013</a></blockquote>

Really, @kcmetrobus? Service through downtown Seattle is severely disrupted and you say **nothing** about it?

But maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. After all, Metro runs an "Eye on Your Metro Commute" blog to tell us these things, right?

[Nope](http://metrocommute.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/metros-monday-am-commute-has-ended-plus-other-transit-service-advisories-alerts/). You see, this incident happened after 9 AM, and "Eye on Your Metro Commute" only covers the peak commute hours, because obviously anyone who rides buses in midday is a loser and We'll Get You There...When We Get You There.

But wait, hold on. The background image on Metro's Twitter feed has something to tell us.

Well you fell down on that last part, but OK, how about we give that website a try. Now, when I want to check for service alerts, it's probably because I'm on some street corner somewhere wondering where the fuck my bus is, so I'm sure that website is mobile-optimized.

Well, that's not exactly a responsive layout, but I guess those headers are big enough to hit without needing to zoom in. But which one do I want? I'm pretty sure I'm not concerned about "planned construction or events," but "Service Advisories" sounds closest...

Are you fucking kidding me? The lines in that table are too small to read, much less click on. And none of them seem to have anything to do with the disruption!

Hold on, let's go back to the first page. What's that in the upper right? "Metro Transit Alert RSS Feeds?" Hmm, that might be the ticket...assuming you have a mobile device that formats RSS in some readable format, which none of the ones I tried do. Otherwise, you can finally get the information you seek if you can pick it out of the RSS and HTML that surrounds it.

You see, Twitter is a service that is perfectly designed to deliver concise, timely updates to a large number of people. It should be the primary way information about service disruptions is disseminated online, not an afterthought.

A key word here is concise. Twitter limits tweets to 140 characters, so it's important not to waste them, say by repeating yourself:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Metro’s Monday AM commute begins; plus other transit service advisories &amp; alerts: Metro’s Monday morning commu... <a href="http://t.co/Z9HbAF8kgY">http://t.co/Z9HbAF8kgY</a></p>&mdash; King County Metro (@kcmetrobus) <a href="https://twitter.com/kcmetrobus/statuses/366907937647636481">August 12, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But maybe I'm being too harsh, I mean the Twitters are newfangled technology. It's not like there are any good examples of how to...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Southbound 29 State buses are temporarily rerouted via State, 26th, Michigan, 31st, and State.</p>&mdash; cta (@cta) <a href="https://twitter.com/cta/statuses/366370030071451649">August 11, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Southbound 29 State buses have resumed their normal routing.</p>&mdash; cta (@cta) <a href="https://twitter.com/cta/statuses/366377268529999873">August 11, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Or maybe there are.

But there is one sure way to get up-to-the-minute updates from @kcmetrobus &mdash; make sure @kcmetrobus is on the bus with you.
