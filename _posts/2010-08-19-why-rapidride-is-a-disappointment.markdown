On October 2nd, Metro will introduce [RapidRide][0], its attempt at "bus rapid transit," or BRT, which as its website says is a system that "combines the efficiency and appeal of light rail with the flexibility and low cost of buses."  Now there are many arguments to be made that even when implemented correctly, BRT is inferior to light-rail.  But RapidRide doesn't even come close.  Here's why.

Let's start at the beginning.  What makes light rail "efficient?"  For one thing, the train spends more time moving than stopped.  What makes this possible?  Well, the train has priority at traffic signals, which is something that RapidRide will also have.  But it also has short dwell times and wide stop spacing.

Let's start with short dwell times.  On Link Light Rail, the train stops, doors open, people get off, people get on, doors close, train departs.  **There is no line of people waiting to board through a single door and pay a cash fare.**

But there will be on RapidRide!

That's right: according to the RapidRide [website][1], if you are paying cash, you must pay your fare at the front door, same as any other bus.  And what if you have ORCA?  Well then you can pay before boarding - as long as you're at a RapidRide "station" and not just a RapidRide "stop."  Otherwise you have to tap your ORCA at the front door as you board...same as any other bus.

And then there's stop spacing.  It doesn't matter how short your dwell times are if the vehicle is stopping too often.  On Link Light Rail, there are 13 stations on 13.9 miles of track - an average spacing of just over 1 mile.  But for [RapidRide A][2], there are 25 stops on a 10.9 mile route, which means an average stop spacing of **under half a mile**.  At a time when Metro is putting many local routes on "stop diets" to improve travel times and reliability, it is mind-boggling that they would allow such gluttony on a service that is supposed to be "rapid."  But since Metro's modus operandi for implementing RapidRide seems to be to rebrand an existing route as RapidRide (in the case of RapidRide A, the 174), we end up with local stop spacing on a supposedly "rapid" service.

There is a caveat: RapidRide won't necessarily stop at every one of these stops. Like all other Metro buses but unlike light rail, RapidRide coaches only stop if someone pulls the cord or is waiting by the roadside.  According to Metro, "stop-request signals, which people can use to alert the bus driver when they are waiting for a bus at night, will be provided at all stations."  So instead of the safety and comfort of a well-lit light-rail station, I get a blinky light on a signpost in the dark next to the road?  Thanks, Metro!

RapidRide's failures are even more saddening when you consider that just to the north in Snohomish County, Community Transit's [Swift][3] Bus Rapid Transit service gets things right where RapidRide doesn't.  All fare collection is off-board.  Stops are spaced 1 to 2 miles apart, and Community Transit's Route 101 provides local service along the same corridor.  Buses stop at every station, no stop cords or strobe lights required.  They even have nifty on-board bike racks whereas RapidRide will have the same front-mounted bike racks as other Metro buses.  The only way RapidRide wins is by its frequency - RapidRide will have 15-minute or better service 7 days a week, whereas Swift has 20-minute frequency evenings and Saturdays and sadly NO service on Sundays due to budget cuts.

To be sure, RapidRide is an improvement over regular Metro service.  But really that's because regular Metro service sets a very low bar.  I love one of the features toted by the RapidRide website: "every trip always the same, coming and going."  Really?  You mean I don't have to ask myself, "did this bus originate in the Seattle CBD between 6 AM and 7 PM?" when trying to figure out if I'll need to pay when I get on or get off?  You mean this bus doesn't serve totally different destinations under the same route number (like the 5) or change route numbers mid-route on some trips (like the 2s that become 13s downtown)? You mean this bus doesn't force you to get off through the front door after 7 PM (at least I hope this is true)?

Some members of the City Council have questioned Mayor McGinn's call for west-side light rail because of the RapidRide lines planned for Ballard and West Seattle.  But if RapidRide is what passes for BRT in this town, then by all means, let's build some light rail.
