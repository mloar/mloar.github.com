SEATTLE - At a press conference this morning, ostensibly called to discuss looming cuts to bus service, King County Metro General Manager Kevin Desmond shocked reporters by launching into a tirade against the Washington State Legislature and his bosses on the Metropolitan King County Council.

He began by presenting a map showing potential reductions in service across the county. "So Shoreline, yeah, they're fucked. Wedgwood, Laurelhurst, fucked. Burien, totally fucked."

He then lambasted the Legislature for passing only a temporary funding source in 2011, setting the stage for the current crisis. "How the hell am I supposed to do long-term planning for regional growth when I don't know if the rug will be pulled out from under me next year? I keep getting complaints about overcrowded buses, and I can't do a damn thing about it. I'm not a fucking miracle worker. I can't turn water into wine and I can't turn shit into service hours. The motherfucking Legislature needs to stop using Metro as a political football and give me a funding source.

"And don't get me started on West Seattle. That backstabbing [Governor] Gregoire was supposed to get me an MVET as part of this tunnel deal, but she threw me under the bus at the first opportunity. Plus the measly mitigation funding is about to run out and the stupid tunnel boring machine isn't even in Seattle yet!"

Desmond then tore into the members of the King County Council, saying "They publicly order me to go find ways to cut costs, but then they pull me aside in the hallway and say, 'Don't touch the route that goes by my house, because my neighbor's father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate rides it sometimes. So leave it alone.'" Pounding his fist on the podium, he added "it's fucking bullshit."

He then announced another fare increase to take effect next year, stating "I'm forwarding every piece of hate mail I get about this to Larry Phillips. Every damn one."

Desmond then became even more agitated, announcing that he was "going back to New York where the politicians realize that transit costs money." He then shouted "Desmond out," dropped the microphone on the floor, and stormed out of the room.

As of press time, King County Executive Dow Constantine had not responded to a request for comment.
