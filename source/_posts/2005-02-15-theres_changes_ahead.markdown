Yeah, that's right. In my copious free time, I will be giving my blog a
makeover. I may move it off of Blog\*Spot, too, I'm not sure yet. Oh, but yes,
the changes are coming...




Anyway, reason number 21618 why I love U of I: Looking at the clock at 11:45
and saying, "Hey, maybe I'll head up to Engineering Hall and finish my Machine
Problem," and this being fine because the lab is open till one in the morning.




Oh, and my apologies for not sending anybody anything for V-Day. Though it's
not like I got anything, so I don't know why I'm apologizing. But I am. Though
Jen did send me a card, albeit for my birthday, with a bunch of photos from
the summer. And one is now "prominently displayed" above my desk, and will be
"prominently displayed" on theFacebook as soon as I can use the scanner at
work.
