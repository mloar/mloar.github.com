So today was the first day of classes. I had two: Algorithms and Programming
Languages (the one I dropped last semester due to the incredible stupidity of
the TA's and professor). This semester it won't be too bad - hopefully.




Tomorrow I have a Special Topics course in computer security. I've heard it's
pretty lame, but hopefully it's not true. And even if it is, "pretty lame" ==
"easy A" - hopefully. Then tomorrow evening I take the train to Chicago so
that I can attend my sister's wedding on Saturday.




I'm a little disappointed about where I ended up living. It's a 1-bedroom in
an old Victorian house, and it's not too expensive, but it's a) far from
campus, and b) unfurnished. Jacky had given me the email address of a girl he
knew interested in subleasing her place, but she didn't get back to me until
Monday, and I didn't read the email until yesterday. Her place? Two blocks
from the Siebel Center.




So anyway, Microsoft did end up making me a full-time offer, and I think I'm
going to accept. So just one more year of this drudgery, and then it's back
out to sunny Redmond to start my career in earnest. I'm starting to think that
maybe the MS Ambassador program should not comprise part of that year, though;
it's become increasingly clear that it's a worthless program run by
incompetent morons.
