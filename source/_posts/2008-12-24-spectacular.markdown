As I stay home from work for the fourth straight day, the Seattle Times publishes this:
[Seattle refuses to use salt; roads "snow packed" by design][0].




So apparently the huge spike in emergency calls, pulling what few buses are running out of snow-filled intersections, and the huge loss of tax revenue from having stores closed or deserted on what are supposed to be the busiest shopping days of the year are preferable to using a little salt.




Good job!
