Well, here's a quick update on what's been going on with me:




Last night, I ordered a [Linode][0] for SamAMac. I'm still not quite sure what
I'm going to do with it, but it seemed like a good idea.




Then this morning, I got another customer for SamAMac. Strangely enough, it
was a guy who I'd considered purchasing a domain reseller account from. Weird.
Also weird that it came just a little bit after I'd done the first significant
thing for SamAMac in a while.




I also found out about something called [Mono][1]. And no, it's not a disease
you get from playing Spin the Bottle. It's actually a .NET Framework for
Linux! This could be very cool, because as you already know, I've begun
developing a spam-blocking MTA in C\#. Now, it wouldn't be very widely used if
all it ran on was Windows, now would it? But with Mono, it could potentially
run on Linux, BSD, Solaris...you name it. I guess C\# is platform-independent
after all!




And I still am working on that SAFER program. The holdup right now isn't
actually SAFER, but System Policies. The format of a .pol file is extremely
irritating, but I have to use it if I want the changes my program makes to
show up in the Security Policy Editor. Bummer.
