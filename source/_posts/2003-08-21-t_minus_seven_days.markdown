Realized that school starts in a week. I guess it's time to read Wuthering
Heights. Interesting tidbit: Mrs. Mattingly, the bookstore lady, says that
Wuthering Heights is her favorite book. I hate it. It's just like my writing:
archaic words and unnecessarily long sentences, but without the wonderful
puns.




Have all of this Key Club stuff to sort through. Jen never gave me the stuff
she said she had for me.




Just 8 more days until I have wasted $30 on my reseller account. Set up a new
voicemail number for SamAMac: 206-350-INET. It's free. I like free. If I
actually got some customers at some point, I could get a toll-free number for
$2/mo. That would be cool.




Updates to just about every site and blog I run coming RSN (read _The Cuckoo's
Egg_ and this will make sense).




Going to watch a stupid last-season episode of Enterprise that I missed
tonight. Also, practice "lateral thinking" with new book I got in Boston.
Bronte and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle may join in the fun.




Oh yes, and my Boston report. I'll do that tonight. Yes. That's it.
