Methods of transferring funds between banks:  

**ACH:** Takes two to three bank business days.  

**Wire transfer:** Possibly same-day. Both the sending and receiving bank
are likely to charge you an obscene fee.  

**SneakerWire:** Withdraw cash from ATM, walk to teller window.
Instantaneous and free if you do it right.




Methods of fraud prevention:  

**Rational:** When suspicious transactions occur, call the customer and ask
if they are authorized.  

**Reality:** Just start declining transactions at random. Wait for
customer to call from their home phone and deal with your automated phone
system.




In theory, credit unions are supposed to be less obnoxious, as all the
depositors have an ownership interest. In reality, the only credit union I've
ever been a member of will charge you a dollar "Foreign ATM Fee" if you withdraw
cash at any ATM outside their extensive network covering both Champaign
**and** Urbana.




Considering what interest rates are like these days, I just wish my mattress was
FDIC-insured.
