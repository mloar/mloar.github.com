Well, today was the day of the math team regional competition. Willowbrook was
beat out, largely by private schools, but Kevin placed in the Algebra II
contest. We didn't do that badly overall. Tonight I have to work on _A
Farewell to Arms_, and at some point there will be a Key Club board meeting.
Jen also has expressed interest in seeing _Gods and Generals_, but I'm not
sure that would fit in tonight. Fortunately, next weekend provides twice the
opportunity. I also should get some work done on the Spanish country project.
Evil incarnate!
