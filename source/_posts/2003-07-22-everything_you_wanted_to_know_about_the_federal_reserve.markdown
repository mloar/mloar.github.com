\*but were afraid to ask




Guess where I went today. That's right! I went downtown to the Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago to learn about...the Federal Reserve System. Man, it was
boring. I have to go again tomorrow.




I rode the train there and back. This afternoon I walked home from the train
station, 3.5 miles, wearing a suit, of course. Somebody apparently told my
computer, since it decided to not start. I turned it off and decided to do
some work under the hood that I had been meaning to do anyway, and here I am,
a few hours later, with none of the stuff (well, I just called Kyle, that's
one thing down) that I had planned to do today done. I have to do a Level 1
Diagnostic (that's Trekkie for: "Make sure everything still works"), and I am
really tired. I say, the Federal Reserve should be like a Variable Phase
Inducer. Nobody knows what it is or how it works, but nobody really cares,
either.
