[First lesbians, now aliens. What will this girl make out with next?][0]




Today was OK. History was fun. I actually gave my presentation in Pre-Calc
without my voice getting all nervous-sounding. Kirby came over at lunch to ask
if I remembered the name of that Communist that we were supposed to look up, I
didn't. I met with Mrs. Constien after school to discuss my paper. I seriously
need to work on my thesis and/or outline. Argh! While I was waiting for Mrs.
Constien to get back from who-knows-where, I chatted with Elizabeth G. and
Kirby, who were also waiting. My point: English sucks.
