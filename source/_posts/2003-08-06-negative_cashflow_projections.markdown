I realized last night that my monthly payment to interAdvantage would be due
tomorrow, and I still haven't gotten a single customer. I'm going to start
looking for those notices from the County Clerk in the paper and sending them
junk mail-I mean, advertisements. I'm also going to redesign the SamAMac site
again, and try and make it look a little more professional. I'm also trying to
come up with some kind of innovative gimmick to draw customers. Any
suggestions? I'll be sure to remember you when I take over the world.
