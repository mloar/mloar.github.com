[Ol' Ryan is actually earning his keep (almost).][0]




Still haven't gotten my MIT interview set up. MIT site says I should set it up
by the 20th, which is Monday, but I'm still screwed.




I hate calculus.




Mr. V is still trying to steal my job. He doesn't realize he's not qualified
for my job. I still think I did a good job of showing him that he needs to
chill out.




Tomorrow is Friday. Yay. Had pretty much nothing but calculus tonight, which
means that my calc is still nowhere near done. Shucks.
