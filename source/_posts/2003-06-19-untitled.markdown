Had the Key Club board meeting today. They rejected my subcommittee proposal,
but the more I think about it, the more I think that they would be unnecessary
and counterproductive. My original purpose for having them was to preserve the
"required" committee names while grouping all related functions under a single
committee. Oh well. I'm going to take another look at the entire system that I
developed. Other than that, the meeting went pretty well. Afterward, Chris and
I went to Panera Bread, then we went to my house to hang out for awhile. My
sister Abbie's coming in on the redeye tonight. Life is good.
