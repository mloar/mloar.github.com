Yay! I was just looking through my site stats and noticed that Googlebot had
paid my site a visit yesterday (Aug 3). So I checked, and now my site is the
top hit for "SamAMac Communications." Unfortunately, that stupid ODP still
comes up first for "SamAMac." I should never have become and ODP editor with
that username. Darn!
