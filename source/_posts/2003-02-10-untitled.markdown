OK, so here I am, sitting in my semi-clean office, listening to obscure
Beatles songs (it's a Beatles "Fourplay" weekend on Magic 104.3). Mary and Jen
are away at Model UN, which kind of sucks, since I need Jen to sign the
January report so I can mail it by tomorrow. I have to get it signed and in
the mail tomorrow. It's funny, I've made it a point of honor that I get it in
the mail a few days early each month, but this month it will be close. Well,
I'm doing this because I don't feel like starting my homework. Hmm, we have
next Monday off. Rock on! I'm also trying to find a programming project to
pique my interest. Ah! I need to set Max(SamAMac2, 192.168.1.4) up on his new
desk. Also, I was interested in learning more about BIND and DNS. That's what
I'll do! Ha ha ha!
