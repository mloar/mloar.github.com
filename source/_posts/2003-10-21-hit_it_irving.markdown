Rock on! My mom called MIT today and they gave me this other guy, who lives in
Wheaton. Kildeer, Wheaton...Kildeer, Wheaton... Anyway, I just tried to call
him but he wasn't home. But whoever the nice lady who answered the phone was,
she took my name and number and said he'd call me. Yay!!!




A strange thing happened at school today. I didn't get any homework. At least
nothing due tomorrow. I'm not going to squander the time though, I have plenty
to do. It's just a shame this couldn't have happened tomorrow, when I have a
scholastic bowl meet. Glenbard West. We play York and Lyons Township.
According to Mrs. Joyce, Lyons (the conference dominator) fears us. We so
rock.




Got the tape of the board meeting in English today. It was kind of funny.
First a messenger walks in with a stack of papers (invitations from Mrs.
Constien for all the National Merit people to meet for a picture). Then,
before Mr. Blair has a chance to distribute them, another messenger walks in
with the tape. Mr. Blair lamented that nobody ever sends him money.




Well, I'm off to get many important things accomplished.




I'm not going to think about my grades at this point, because today is too
good to be depressed over something as trivial as grades.
