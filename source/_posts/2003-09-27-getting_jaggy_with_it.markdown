Today wasn't too bad. I stayed up late trying to get my Chem and Calc done,
and then the Chem wasn't due and Mrs. Butler gave us till Monday. Oh well.




Went to Peanut Day after school. We had quite a few people, and it went pretty
well. Rock on!




Got a newsletter from Allison today. Guess what? Dues are now $10.50! Nice to
know that before we started collecting, right?
