Hello. Finally ordered the corsage. Rock on. I'm just about to get cracking on
my homework. Today was kind of bad. The lab in physics didn't go too well. If
I have time, I'm going to try building the circuit at home and see if I can
get it to work. I still need to find a suit, and I have a million other things
to do. Sigh...I can't wait for spring break.
