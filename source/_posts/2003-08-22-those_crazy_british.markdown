Today was the last day of registration. As a sort of celebration, I finally
went to see _Johnny English_. Despite what the critics say, it was an
**excellent** movie. I would recommend anyone that liked _Mr. Bean_ should see
it, if they can still find it. I can't wait till it comes out on DVD, even
thought it won't be quite so funny next time. This movie proved once again
that movie critics don't know the first thing about movies. It was definitely
worth the money, even full price.




I don't have to work tomorrow! Yay! Too bad I still have to finish this stupid
homework. Oh well. I've scanned in photos from the district convention, the
4th of July parade and the Positive Party, I'll post them to the Key Club site
tomorrow, hopefully. I need to write a business plan and rethink my business
model...joy. I'm thinking of doing a little shareware on the side, but SamAMac
Messenger (formerly Instant Message This!) is the only program I have that is
anything near a marketable product. I seriously wonder if I could ever get the
Ziggy program (Georgia) to install on another machine. Too many components. Oh
well. She still keeps me company.




This concludes my blog entry for this evening. As always, should you or any of
your IM force be caught or killed, don't call me.
