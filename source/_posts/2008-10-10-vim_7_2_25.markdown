I finally took care of an item that has been on my to-do list for a while and
built MSIs for Vim 7.2\.




This MSI also incorporates a correction I have already made to the PuTTY MSI to
not display a license agreement dialog. After the recent Mozilla EULA fiasco, I
investigated why I had been including one in the first place. It turns out that
all of the stock WiX UI sequences include one. If you don't specify a license,
WiX helpfully includes the CPL. So I built a custom UI sequence to eliminate
the dialog.




You can find the new Vim MSI on the [Vim][0] page.
