I just applied to two colleges in the span of an hour. MIT will follow
shortly.




CD burner broken after Mom killed circuit on Thurs. Replaced with old CD-ROM
from Uncle Paul, now it won't play half of my CDs.




Somehow, I had one of the most productive days of my life today, but didn't
make a dent in my To-Do list or homework.




Man, I'm getting tired. It's a good thing that it's Daylight Savings tonight,
I need the extra hour.
