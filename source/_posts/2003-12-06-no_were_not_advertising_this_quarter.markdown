[You hit it on the head, Dave][0].




Friday. I missed the Civitas meeting. Oh well. Mrs. Marcyinuk told me that it
was going to be sent this morning. That's great, considering she told me that
it would be sent out by yesterday morning. Honestly.




Nothing else worth noting happened until Econ. After the test, we played this
silly advertising game. It was stupid really, except for this part where I had
to lie to Bonnie. But enough about that.




After school, I waited for Renee to pick me up to go decorate the tree. I
finally called her house, and her mother gave me her cell number. Then I
called her, and she was lost trying to find Farooq's house. She's obviously
directionally challenged. Anyway, we decorated the tree (I forgot the camera
again).




Nothing else worth noting has happened since. Tomorrow I'm going to U of I for
Scholars Day. Yay.
