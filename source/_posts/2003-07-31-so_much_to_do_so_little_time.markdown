Well, today went alright. Kyle came over again to mess with his computer. Then
we went to work the last Kiwanis Concert. It was good. Dale showed up and gave
me a ride on his motorcycle. It was great. Anyway, now I'm sitting down here,
and I read on Dave Barry's blog that he'll be on the Today show, so I'm
thinking of getting up early. The only problem with getting up early is that
I'd feel guilty about not getting up early every day. If there was somewhere I
had to go, that would be different, but I don't have to go anywhere. Sigh...
And I can't remember my CORES password (FCC licensing), and it's driving me
nuts. Anyway, Kyle was wondering why he wasn't a committee chair, since he
asked me on my first day as president, and I didn't know what to tell him. I
made him a deal that if Caroline and Emily don't accept, I would make him
Membership chair, but that's not good enough, apparently. Sigh... We have a
board meeting on Monday and the Positive Party is Thursday. I'm going nuts.
I'd better get moving if I want to accomplish something before I go to bed
early.
