"Where'd you learn to speak Czech?"




"Correspondence school."




"So Czech's in the mail?"




-MacGyver, "For Love or Money"




So I didn't really get to see any fireworks on account of all the lousy rain.
Bummer. My dad, brother and I went golfing today, and ended up stranded in the
lightning shelter by the 3rd green for 45 minutes.




My dad's 65th birthday party on Saturday went pretty well. We were at a forest
preserve, and we went fishing. All I caught were a bluegill and a grass bass.




Well, two midterms on Thursday!
