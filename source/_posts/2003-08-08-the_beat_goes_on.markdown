Well, I was finally able to post my entries from last night. Stupid Blogger.




Positive Party went well. My team won "Bigger and Better." Then Chris came
over so I could copy some stuff for him. Might be sleeping over at his house
tomorrow night. Then I'm meeting with Brianna on Saturday. Next Wednesday I
leave for Boston. It seems I'll have to go to school for my life to slow down
a bit.




Call from Kyle earlier confirms my strong suspicions that Radio Shack guys
work on commission.




Mom criticizes my Best Buy Reward Zone membership. I'm sure it will pay off in
the long run. A lot more than my reseller account has so far.




Man, I'm tired.
