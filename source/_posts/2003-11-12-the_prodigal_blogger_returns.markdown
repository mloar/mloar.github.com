OK, I haven't posted since Thursday. Well, here's a summary of my four-day
weekend (brief, because I have homework to do):




-Friday: After doing cans (and Chris breaking a couple), Chris came over and
we played Rebel Strike before going to see Matrix Revolutions. Movie kinda
sucked. Then we went to Denny's (Chris, Kyle, Mary, that other guy whose name
I can't remember, and me), and then we went back to Kyle's house. On the way,
one of the back windows in Chris' mom's truck broke spontaneously. Then I had
to go back to his house with him to tell his mother he didn't break it with a
baseball bat or something.




-Saturday: Spent the first part of the day up at my sister's sleeping, then
Chris came over and we played more Rebel Strike instead of doing Chemistry.




-Sunday: Went to the NHS cleanup with Chris, got some Portillo's, played more
Rebel Strike, went to church, and then did something. Don't remember quite
what.




-Monday: Spent 6 hours at school for Parent Conferences. Didn't get any
homework done.




-Tuesday: Kyle's over doing who knows what on his computer, and I'm trying to
get my homework done.




There it is.
