Well, today was a busy day. I finally got a ticket, so I'll be going out on a
call tomorrow. Also, today was the ACM Sig Chair workshop. In a week or so,
I'll have my 24-hour Siebel access! Too cool. Then I had my last Physics
midterm. Afterward I treated myself to an Old-Fashioned Shake from Moonstruck.




And it's only Monday.
