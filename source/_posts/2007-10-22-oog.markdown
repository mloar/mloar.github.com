If you exclude the last six hours, I have accomplished nothing this weekend.
And the last six hours only include upgrading my apartment from "disaster
area" to "sty," switching to zsh, and putting some dotfiles in subversion.




OK, so that may not be entirely accurate. I did spend a significant portion of
yesterday setting up a tracker and torrents for the [Reflections Projections
2007 videos][0]. It's probably too little too late, though. We were doing OK
until Eric Traut's video got posted to Slashdot. Apparently people were all
excited about his MinWin demo. I hadn't previously thought that MinWin was
anything to get excited about, but whatever.




I need to find a good way to track personal projects and remind myself to do
things. I considered setting up a personal Trac instance, but that may be a
bit much. Right now I've just adopted Russ Allbery's [reminder][1] program.




Speaking of projects, I need to decide what to do about the [Wipt][2] project.
I don't have the time to put in the vast amount of work needed to make it
really useful. Hopefully, future versions of Windows will address the
deficiencies that inspired the project in the first place. I think I'll end up
killing it and redirecting to a personal repository at this domain for the
packages I care about (namely, PuTTY and Vim).




Well, it's time for bed. I plan to start getting up earlier and working more
normal hours.




Like that will happen.
