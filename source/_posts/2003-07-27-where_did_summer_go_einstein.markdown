Wow, summer is going by fast. I have all of this stuff for Key Club and school
to take care of. I have the Positive Party, the Board Meeting, committee
chairs, and the baseball game. Oh well. I spent awhile up at my sister's
today, and I just did my part to keep Quizilla going by running a text ad for
SamAMac on their site. Cool, eh? Entrepreneurship, ho!
