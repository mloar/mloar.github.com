Well, from 8 this morning to noon I was putting slimy potatoes in bags, all so
I could stay in the stupid National Honor Society. I hate NHS.




I ordered a reseller plan yesterday, but unfortunately I ordered the wrong
one. I'm going to ask them to change it and throw them a carrot by paying for
6 months worth of service up front.




Other than that, life is all right. My parents are going to a party tonight,
so I'll have the house to myself. Yay.
