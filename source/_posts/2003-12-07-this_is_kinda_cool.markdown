Well, today I went to Scholars Day at U of I. First of all, that campus is
amazing. The first thing was the welcome in the Foellinger Great Hall, which
is probably the largest auditorium I've ever been in. Anyway, then we had
lunch in one of the dorms and saw what the residence halls are like. I wonder
if they took us through the WIMSE (Women in Math, Science, and Engineering)
section on purpose. Probably. Anyway, then we went to a session for the
college of Engineering. They were talking about all of the opportunities, yada
yada yada. What I learned was that at U of I, AP actually counts for
something, unlike the 2 other schools I've visited. MIT accepts very few
tests, while Olin doesn't accept any. Anyway, I would probably get a
substantial number of semester hours from my credit, which I could use to
complete my degree requirements early, take on a minor, or just slack off a
little. Anyway, then I took the Computer Science tour. I really liked the
CompSci building, but they'll be moving into a brand new building next year.
They also have a CompSci club called ACM which is huge and does all of this
cool stuff. Later I took the bus tour, and the guy thought everything was
either "really nice" or "kinda cool." Then I came home.




Anyway, it was a lot of fun.




I'm having trouble coming up with things for my Christmas list. Oh well.
