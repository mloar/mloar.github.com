I'm back...




Boston was great! I'd be more than happy to tell you all about it, but I have
to go to bed so I can get up and work registration tomorrow (I know, me
working! what a concept!). Meanwhile, we are pleased to be able to bring you
these photographs:

I have to catch Phil and Chris tomorrow, as it appears that the baseball game
is not free. Figures. Stingy Kiwanis.
