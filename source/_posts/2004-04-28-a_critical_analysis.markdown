Today kinda sucked. First I didn't have my homework done for Chemistry on
account of the very busy weekend and Econ Challenge and the satire essay I had
to write last night. So I didn't have it. She did say she'd take it later,
though. But I failed the quiz anyway.




Then I went to English and read my satire essay. Everybody loved it. I've put
it on the [web][0].




New Skylines today. ExposÃ(C) on the AP stuff on the cover, byline to Niemet
and Katie D. Niemet and Katie D. called to meeting with Dr. E today, which I
hear from Niemet did not go well. School sucks.




Food fight in cafeteria. Student body held responsible.




Rest of day sucked. NHS induction practice pointless. NHS induction pretty
pointless too.




Got Mrs. PiÃ±a to take care of the one scholarship app thing, and requested a
couple of transcripts which I have to pick up tomorrow. I'm going to need
more. At this point, there doesn't seem to be any scholarships that I'd hear
from by Mr. Tyler's mid-May deadline. Pointless.




VP Bank scholarship dinner tomorrow night. Stupid, and will preclude me from
doing my Chemistry.
