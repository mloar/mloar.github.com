OK, so yesterday was the pep assembly (finally). It was great. The best part
was at the end, when the senior Poms came out wearing these shirts that said
"Senior Poms Rule" to do a routine by themselves. Halfway through, Mr. Zaucha
shouts, "Wait a minute! You call that dancing?" At that point he ripped off
his windbreaker to reveal a shirt which read "Pom Wannabe" and was joined by
several other male members of the faculty. The two groups did a joint routine
which culminated in them throwing Mr. Zaucha in the air. That was good.




Anyway, yesterday I spent some time working on the cable system. I succeeded
in drilling another hole through the floor for another cable, like I had tried
last year. It seems to be working well, since the cable modem hasn't gone down
since \[gratuitous wood-knocking\]. I spent the rest of yesterday writing a
screenplay. Chris and I formed this idea that it would be funny to make our
own 'B' sci-fi movie, so I started writing a screenplay. I think I've let it
escape our production abilities, though. Oh well.
