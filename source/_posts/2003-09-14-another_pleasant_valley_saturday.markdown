Whoever was DJ on Oldies (they changed it back, by the way) 104.3 this morning
intoduced "Pleasant Valley Sunday" like that.




Straight up. With an olive. What did I tell you?




Guess what I got done today? Right! Nothing! Well, actually I did get the Key
Club Member Database online, but nothing in the sense of the homework I have
to do. Renee was shocked I haven't even started the essay due Monday, but I
figure that I never really start essays till the day before, and why should I
start now?




Kyle called me up, wanting to do something. My dad had gone to this church
thing, so we went to see a movie. (Funny story: Kyle parked in our spot since
16th Street is all torn up, and he was only there for a couple of minutes, but
when we left to see the movie, the security guys were there. My dad had come
home and found Kyle in his spot and run into the security guys who patrol
Brandywine in the space of maybe 5 minutes. Weird.) We saw Matchstick Men, and
though Kyle said it had no plot (absolutely untrue) it was great. I give it 4
stars. I'm going to have to start my own movie rating service. Hmmm....there
we go. Maverick's Movies!
