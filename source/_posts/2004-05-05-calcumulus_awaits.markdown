Just a quick note, because I have to study for calculus. I should have been
studying for calculus for the last three hours, but you know me...




AP Comp Sci exam today. It was all right.




Calculus AP tomorrow. Yay.




There was a meeting of the senior class club after school today about the
senior class gift that I was thinking about attending, but I decided not to.
Enh.




Got a note from Mr. Johnson today in, of all things, Auto. Looks like I'll be
giving a speech at graduation. Sara will too. Funny thing is, the note said to
go to his office tomorrow at 11, and both Sara and I have the AP test at that
time. So I went and talked to the secretary because Mr. Johnson was busy, and
she said it would be straightened out.




I have so far asked two girls to prom and received two "I don't know"s ("I
don't know if I can go to prom", not "I don't know if I want to go with you",
mind you). So anyway, that's my life.




Now it's off to do the last studying for Calculus this year, except the
preparation for that stupid "Blue Book" test which I will struggle vainly to
prepare for in an effort not to get a C for 4th quarter. Which reminds me, I
need to find the answer guide for the blue book. Hmmm....




P.S. They finally figured it out. Eric Pingolt's photo is now before mine.
