Okey dokey, here's what I got:




-Super Mario Sunshine for GameCube




-Strange Brew DVD




-Best Buy gift card




-4 new Bond novels




-Atomic alarm clock




-2 Page-A-Day calendars




Anyway, I've spent most of the last two days playing Super Mario, except for
yesterday when I played pool with Kyle and Mary. Also, today Bonnie expressed
her love for me. OK, OK, so it was "i love you" because you're helping me get
rid of that annoying AIM worm, but still.




Lots o' work to do.
