So I wake up about 12:30 despite having stayed up past 5\. I shower, dress, and
then lounge around.




I turn on Spike TV and discover that they have picked up MacGyver. They are
now officially my favorite network.




Then about halfway through an episode I've seen probably 5 times, I get a call
on the north side of Champaign. I check out the CITES truck and head on up
there.




I don't get done till 5:30, at which point the office has already closed. It's
Friday, so no one will miss the truck till Monday morning. So I head off to
Wal-Mart, just for the heck of it. I end up buying a spindle of CD-R's, which
I'll be using for work anyway. Then I return the keys.




Now I'm sitting in my room, waiting for Numbers to come on, avoiding all the
stuff I should be working on, and dreading getting my grades.




Wow, today was pathetic.
