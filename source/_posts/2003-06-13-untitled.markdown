You are a geek/nerd.. You love computers, GET SOME




EXERCISE!! if you don't, chances are, you'll




die in from of the computer, in the middle of a




game of vertual chess, or dungeons and




dragons.. Either from a cancerous tumor from




the radiation of your computer screen, or from




a heartattack. In which case, you'll probably




be found, one hand on the keyboard, the other




hand on a spam sandwhich.. GO OUTSIDE!! You




NEED fresh air!!
