I meant to get up at 10, but got up at 11:30 instead.




Finished _The Fatal Equilibrium_. It was OK. Now I want to finish _Macbeth_
before the end of the day. If I keep up this level of productivity, I should
be in good shape.




Emailed Claire about donation requests for Battle of the Bands. I have to
arrange a board meeting for this week, but I don't know where I could hold it.
I'll have to see, but I have to figure it out quickly.




Well, it's time to get back to work. More updates on the Adventures of the
Gooshiemeister later.
