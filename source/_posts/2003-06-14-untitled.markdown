OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH! It's Friday the 13th!




Well, I certainly had an interesting day. First Kyle comes over to work on
that stupid light thing, then I got my business registration form notarized,
and then, of course, it was Stargate Premiere Night. It was good. My mom said
we might yet order pizza. Coolness.




Well, I'm preparing to get my business off of the ground. Life is good.




Apparently, I'm the only one who updates my blog. Weirdness.
