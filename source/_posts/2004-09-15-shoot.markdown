So I walk into Calculus at 2, and it's bright and sunny outside. I walk out at
2:50, and it's pouring rain. And Petey and I both discovered that our
backpacks aren't waterproof. My Physics, Econ, and I-Book are all water
damaged. My notebook and folder were totally ruined. Plus I dented my Cranium
metal case.




But as of today, SamAMac Incorporated officially exists! Yay!
