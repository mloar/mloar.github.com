Well, here's what's been going on:




If you haven't heard, I am now Chairman and CEO of SamAMac Incorporated.
Coolness. Now is when you give me money.




On Tuesday we had a freak thunderstorm, and some of my books got wet (Petey's
calc book was ruined; he had waited weeks to get it, too). So I bought some
transparent duct tape and tried to waterproof my backpack. I decided it wasn't
going to stay on, plus it looked dorky, so I tore it off and put it under the
carpet. This seems like a good plan because (a) they say not to use carpet
tape, so I'm thinking half-adhesive duct tape is better, and (b) some of the
adhesive is still on my backpack, which hopefully will provide some protection
the next time it rains.




Petey didn't want to go see Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow with me last
night, deciding rather to sit in his room, futilely searching for someone to
get drunk with. I believe he went to a frat party with DeFalco tonight.
Anyway, I didn't see the movie, but I did discover there is a Blockbuster
within walking distance of the dorm. Cool.




Went to the SIGWin meeting today and learned about C\#.




I would blog more, but my hands are tired and I'm tired even more. So good
night.
