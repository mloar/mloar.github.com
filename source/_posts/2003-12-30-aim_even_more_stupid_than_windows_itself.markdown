OK, let me rant about the latest version of AIM.



    
*   
    
    First of all, the option to turn off the stupid news window everytime you
    long on has been removed. Now we're all subjected to the day's news, stupified
    for AIM's typical demographic.

    Plus, it occasionally will say that it is forwarding my IMs to my cell
    phone. But wait, I don't have a cell phone. OK, so I have the beta version,
    but it's still rather stupid.
    
    
    





OK, so two things. It still sucks.
