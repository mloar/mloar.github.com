The Plan: _National Treasure_ was due at noon at the Blockbuster on Neil
Street. Take bus to boss's office, pick up laptop, return movie to Blockbuster
by noon.




What Actually Happened: I got up late. I walked to Blockbuster and returned
_National Treasure_ a couple minutes after noon. Then I proceded to my boss's
office. He was not there; his office was locked. Receptionist wasn't there
either. Figuring he was on lunch break, I went outside and waited for a while,
he didn't show. For some incredibly stupid reason, I decided to walk back
instead of taking the bus and e-mail my boss. Turns out he was never there.
Yay, sunburn!
