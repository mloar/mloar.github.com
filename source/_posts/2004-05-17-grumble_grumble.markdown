Well, I'm stumped again. I thought I had finally decided on U of I, but then
Friday Kirby told me that she got in to Rice, and I kinda did tell her I'd go
to Houston if she went to Rice, so I don't know what to do. It turned into a
discussion over lunch during the field trip, and just about everybody thought
I should go to Houston, except Chris Defalco and Mrs. Joyce. Houston,
meanwhile, looks suckier all the time.




Anyway, tomorrow is the big let's-take-a-test-to-see-if-you-did-the-review-
for-the-AP-exam in Calculus. I'm steeling myself to get my first C for a
quarter in high school, possibly even a semester. 3rd quarter was great, 4th
quarter has sucked.




I'm currently writing the essays for the Pihos scholarship, which of course is
for U of I. I have to get some crap notarized tomorrow and have Mom run it out
to her office while I interview for the David Koch Scholarship. Joy.




Wore my MIT shirt today, just to remind myself of why I'm in this big stupid
mess.
