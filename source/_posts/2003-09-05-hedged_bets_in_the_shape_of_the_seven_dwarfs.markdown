I haven't blogged for a little while. I plan to make a more comprehensive post
later, but right now I want to lament the fact that (I thought I was being
savvy) I dumped 75% of my AMD stock a couple of days ago. Today it shot up 6
percent. Oh well. I'm sure that it can't sustain this meteoric rise much
longer, and I'll come out ahead in the long run. Besides, that's why I left
25% of my stock alone. :-)




To clarify, Mr. Isaacson did not write the book to which I've linked. The joke
is that Mr. Isaacson was the origin of the whole "Italian Ghetto" thing, and I
thought it was kind of funny that somebody had written a book with "Italian
Ghetto" in the title. I've searched Amazon.com several times for Mr.
Isaacson's "published book" to no avail. I just had a thought...I should check
the records at the Copyright Office. They're accessible online and should
contain the book, if it does indeed exist.
