Well, in a couple of hours I'll be picking up Renee (hopefully, I haven't been
able to get a hold of her) and heading off to Ms. Engel's wedding reception.
Fun.




Yesterday was a cool day at work. I got there and tried to start Audit Check,
the program I use to do my job, and it wouldn't start. Turned out none of us
temps could get on. So we ended up sorting envelopes again while our
supervisor tried to get a hold of the one guy in the whole company who can do
anything to fix it. That was a nice change of pace. Then it was someone's
birthday, so there was cake. But wait, it gets even better. Manpower called
me in the afternoon. Effective next week, I'll be making $15/hr. Yup.




Then I went home. After having to call my own house to get in the door (no,
Mom, I can't use my key because you locked the screen doors-both of them-and
you haven't answered the doorbell, either. I'm going to install another
doorbell in the basement, just for her.




Saw the Stargate Atlantis premiere. It was cool.




There's a scrape on the back bumper of my aunt' s car. For some reason, Mom
thinks it's my fault, and thinks I'm hiding that I hit another car at work.




A) I didn't, and so I'm not.




B) I'm not the one who parked it on the street last night.




Anyway, she's going to make me pay for half of however much it costs to get it
painted over.




Anyway, I'm not in such a good mood right now, for reasons I can't seem to pin
down. Wait, no, it's because my mother is driving me insane. That's right.




I have to go to Phil Marsh's Eagle Scout Court of Honor tomorrow, whatever
that is.




Did I mention that I got my housing assignment? I'm in Hopkins Hall, which of
course is the westmost dorm in the six-pack, which is as far from everything
as you can get. Yay. It's also a triple. I don't actually have to live in a
dorm, since I have 44 hours of credit already. But I will.




Just about everybody who reads my blog should have received their invitations
today. I got my check today. I hate federal income tax. I've never made
this much money before, so I never realized how much it seriously sucks.
Actually, Money figured out last night that if I made this kind of money all
year long, I'd make $35,000 a year. Kinda cool, actually. Yay for the
college fund!




Ciao!
