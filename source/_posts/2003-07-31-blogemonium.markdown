Blogger appears to have suffered some kind of seizure. Looks like it's over it
now.




I've created a blog for my messages on the Key Club site. I'll offer to set
some up for the other officers. I'm also thinking of creating a "Club News"
blog and putting everybody on it.




I'm still debating what to do with Black Sheep Airlines.
