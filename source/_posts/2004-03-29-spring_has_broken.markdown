Yay for Spring Break.




Spent the weekend at convention. Got there late; confusion ensued. All the
people we voted for won. Didn't get Single Service for Battle of the Bands.
Mary is hereby writing all Single Service Reports for the rest of time.
Realized at forums that our school really sucks. I mean really, totally sucks.
Left my jacket at the hotel (Pheasant Run, heh heh heh), but Mary and Kyle
retrieved it (thanks so much!).




I realized tonight that the last few weeks have just been a string of
failures. No MIT, no Olin, no Single Service Award...this sucks.




Got our nice new hard Key Club member cards on Thursday. Nice.




Jen apparently still hasn't realized that her comments don't work. I was going
to be nice and pay for the subscription, but then I found out that it would
cost like 25 bucks, and I realized that I'm not THAT nice.




So here I am, trying to work on the Key Club site, tossing out all of the
college crap I've kept since last year, and not really wanting to go to
Seattle on Tuesday.
