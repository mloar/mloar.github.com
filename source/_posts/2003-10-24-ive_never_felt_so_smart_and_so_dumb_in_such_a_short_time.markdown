Well, I felt smart because I just got my SAT scores, and I got a 1500: 740
math and 760 verbal.




Then I felt dumb because it took me until now to realize that "Evil Olive" is
a palindrome.




BTW, check out the Evil Olive site, relaunched pro bono at SamAMac: [Evil0livE
Fan Site][0]




I'll be back to gloat some more tomorrow.
