Woohoo! It's Friday!




AMD up 40 cents a share today. Evil incarnate!




The network administrator won the $1,000,000 Jeopardy! Masters Tournament.
Nerd Pride!




I had some new quotes for the Italian Ghetto, but I can't remember what they
are.




The Key Club Meeting is on for Wednesday. It's because next Thursday is Open
House. I finally met with Ms. Engel today. She was all ready to have the
meeting yesterday. Too bad, if I'd gotten in touch with her a little sooner,
we might have been able to keep the schedule. Now we're starting after NHS.
That sucks.




**Top Ten Reasons Key Club is better than NHS**



    
1.  
    
    We're not elitist. You want in, you're in.
    
    
1.  
    
    We're student-led. The officers run the club, not the advisor.
    
    
1.  
    
    We don't make you get up early on Monday mornings for a pointless meeting.
    
    
1.  
    
    We actually do stuff AS A CLUB.
    
    
1.  
    
    We have an annual banquet.
    
    
1.  
    
    We go to conventions.
    
    
1.  
    
    We have stupid little chants and stuff.
    
    
1.  
    
    When you go to college, you can join Circle K!
    
    
1.  
    
    If we need money, we just beg Kiwanis.
    
    
    





AND THE NUMBER ONE REASON KEY CLUB IS BETTER THAN NHS...



    
1.  
    
    It's like Communism!
    
    
    





Anyway, the regular meetings will be on Thursdays.




Also, I checked the Copyright Office, and I could not find "Andrew Isaacson"
in their records. That's something to make you go "Hmmmmmm..."
