Yeah, so today was an atypically productive day.




Finally got that account set up with National City. I think they screwed it
up, but I don't care at this point.




Today was the Circle K new member induction at Bennigan's. Yay, good food for
a change.




Had some studying to do for the econ midterm tomorrow. Didn't get a chance to
study for the calc quiz. Oh, well.




I want to get back to VP over Thanksgiving Break, but I don't know how that
will work. I'm not doing so well in the cash flow department.




Anyway, sleepytime.
