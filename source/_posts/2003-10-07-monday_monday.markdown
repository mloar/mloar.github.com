Simplehost is down. I think it has anticipated Mrs. Joyce. See, I put up a
link to the Econ quizzes on the publisher's site on Italian Ghetto, and now
everybody goes there. Well today, Mrs. Joyce said she was going to the site to
see it for herself, and I was forced to wonder what she would think when she
sees the picture of Chris looking like a stoner (or so many people have told
me, including Chris himself, I think).




I have all sorts of junk to do tonight. Got to pull up all of those wonderful
B's!




Well, dinnertime. Â¡Hasta luego!
