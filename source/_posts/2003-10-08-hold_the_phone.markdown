Actually, I have to analyze the statement, "One evil deed missed is a loss for
all eternity." Here's what I've written so far:




Frankly, I don't know what the hell Grendel is talking about when he says this
whole "One evil deed missed is a loss for all eternity." Call me naive, but I
usually dismiss the actions of sociopathic monsters as a product of a diseased
mind. I don't think that you could deny that Grendel is seriously insane. He
argues with himself, something that I do, but only after years of taking
stupid classes like this one drove me to madness.




EPIPHANY: I just realized why this book sucks. It's written by an American!!!
And here I was thinking that I couldn't stand Brit Lit either. Emily BrontÃ«
is still a terrible author, though.




And from now on, I'm not reading any book endorsed by _The New York Times_.
