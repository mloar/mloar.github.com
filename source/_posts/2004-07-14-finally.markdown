Chemistry: 4




Comp Sci AB: 4




English Lit: 5




Econ Micro: 5




Econ Macro: 5




Calculus BC: 3




-AB subscore: 4




Well, that gets me credit for everything I wanted. I don't know what to do
about Calculus. I technically have credit for Calc II with a 3, and I don't
really want to take Calc II again, especially since Mrs. Butler was saying
that Calc II at U of I was more difficult than Calc III.




But I'm happy. I have 40 credit hours from AP, plus 4 from the Spanish
placement exam. I'll be starting as a sophomore, and at the end of my first
semester I'll be two credit hours shy of being a junior.




I figured it out, though, that if I retain my first semester schedule, I'll
still end up with 3 whole years. That kinda sucks. Abbie thinks it would be
worth it to go for the master's, though.




Update: I'm talking to Petey. He got a 5 on both BC and Chemistry! WTF? He
copied Calc off of me, and he got the answers to Chemistry off the Internet!
