How did I spend this lovely weekend? With the exception of Friday night, which
was spent at my sister's watching a movie, I did almost nothing but write code
the entire weekend. And I'd like to say that I was working on an uber-cool
project that will end world hunger, save the whales and bring balance to the
Force all at the same time, but in reality I was merely working on rewriting
[rwho][0] in C++.




It is slightly more than that - I am simultaneously working on something I am
calling libmel. My original goal was merely to wrap old, clunky C APIs (like
sockets) in a nice C++ layer. It has evolved into a sort of portability layer
- I currently have a unifed socket interface for both Windows and Linux. Of
course, the sockets API is almost identical on both platforms, so it really
isn't much of a feat. What would be slightly more impressive would be to have
a common utmp interface. I already have the code in rwho for reading from the
Terminal Services API, so it should be feasible.




But there must be something seriously wrong with me that I come home from a
week of writing code at work and then spend the entire weekend writing code
for personal projects. I really need to find a new hobby, preferably one that
involves meeting people.




I guess I do have bowling. Tonight, in fact. Time to sleep.
