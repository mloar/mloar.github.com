[This][0] is just about the funniest thing I've ever seen.




Anyway, I'm up here at the Harveys. I spent most of today getting ready for
the board meeting, which went well. Chris kept interrupting with funny
comments, but somehow we got stuff done. Brianna has already sent the email
like she promised. Rock on! This is going to be the best year ever. Anyway, I
finally gave my fellow officers the gifts I had bought for them at Convention,
and they liked them. I'm getting together with Brianna on Saturday to go over
secretarial stuff. And so goes things on the Key Club front.
