Joy. Kyle came over tonight to screw around with his computers again.




Giving blood tomorrow. Yay me.




My mother insists that I need a job, but each place I suggest "would make me
work too many hours."




You are hereby requested and required to visit [Three Dead Trolls in a
Baggie's MP3.com site][0] and download all sorts of songs.




Now back to our regularly scheduled Key Club agenda, and National Merit and
college applications.
