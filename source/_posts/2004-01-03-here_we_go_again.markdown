OK, board meeting today. Went OK, I guess. Not everybody showed up, but I
expected that. My sister came. Ultimately made me feel like the meeting
sucked. But it didn't. We got a lot of stuff done. I think I'll do a little
work on the Key Club site before retiring. That will make me feel better.




Holiday Embrace tomorrow. Snowstorm predicted. Joy! I just hope everything
goes smoothly. I'm driving everybody to the dinner, Chris is driving Ashley to
the dance.




Homework still far from completed. This sucks.
