Well, let's see. What has happened today? Not a whole lot. I got up, put a
bookshelf together, watched part of _Alien Resurrection_ on TV, and cleaned
the gutters. I also got an email from Allison, our wonderful LTG, with more
information about the K-Family project. We're all going to the Kane County
Cougars game on August 18th, free of charge to us. Coolness. Anyway, I've been
working on an email to the board about that and a lot of other stuff. We have
so much to do and so little time. I ran out last night to pick up a copy of
_Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised_, but it turns out it's a big, thick
book that cost $17, so I picked up _Robert's Rules in Plain English_ for
$6.95\. As you can see, I'm planning on bringing just a little formality to
board meetings. I think we need to make formal decisions, so that things will
actually get done. Anyway, I read through the whole thing last night. I've
gotten pretty far in Twelfth Night, but I have to catch up with my stupid
journal. Otherwise, my life is peachy. Apparently, someone visited
samamac.com, because they asked some questions of my [\[Q\]Box][0]. (S)he didn't
order any services, though. At least (s)he thought the site was cool.
