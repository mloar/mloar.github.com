OK, I'll post.




Petey, the roommates and I are currently sitting in the room, bored out of our
minds. Petey and I just returned from a quest to find something to do, to no
avail.




Boredom!!!




Donated blood today. I learned that my blood type (AB+) is actually the second
rarest blood type, after AB-. The technician actually put a "Special Handling"
tag on mine. I must remember to donate more often.




Called Denise to find out how the first meeting went, and got her voicemail.




Got up early to staff Circle K booth at Volunteer Fair.




Tomorrow, my day off, to be devoted to homework and sleep.
