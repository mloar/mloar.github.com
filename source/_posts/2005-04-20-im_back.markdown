First post in a while.




My roommate is driving me nuts. As I write this, he is very loudly bashing the
hell out of his computer keys. Why? Because he's playing "Dance Dance
Revolution" on his computer.




Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of Dance Dance Revolution?




Well, I have a TON of work to do. Hopefully I'll have more time to post later.




Oh, and if anybody wanted to say, come visit me next Friday (the 29th), I'll
be presenting my project for CS Days, and then I want to go see Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy.




You in?
