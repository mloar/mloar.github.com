Woohoo! I just got both my sound card and my 10/100 network card running on
Sandy. I rock.




I'm making progress on the homework. The journals aren't actually due till
Thursday, but I want to finish them tonight. And the first chemistry chapter
isn't due till Friday, if I read the sheet correctly.




I don't want to go back to school. At least it will mean that I'll see people,
and Key Club will be meeting again. So much to do...
