Chem and College-Bound English finals today. Both were pretty easy. Chem was a
little long, but I think I did alright. I think she'll curve it, anyway. So,
tomorrow I have Auto, AP English, and Calculus. I figured it out today. I
would have to get about 150% on the final to get an A for the semester, but I
only have to get about 60% to get a B. Cool, huh? Well, I'm going to go study
anyway. Life is good.
