Well, finals time is nearly here. I've decided to grow a beard for finals, to
give others the impression that I'm studying so hard for finals that I don't
have time for trivial things like personal hygiene. I'd stop combing my hair,
too, but that would require that I had combed it previously.




Still no check card from National Stupidity Bank. I plan to redesign the
SamAMac site at some point.




Did the ICES forms today in Calculus. I volunteered to collect them, so now at
least I can claim that my professor knows my name. Or at least he did for two
seconds. Anyway...




Did laundry today. Mondays are slow, Tuesdays suck.




Econ test Thursday. I really ought to study or something, but I'm pretty sure
the marginal utility of additional study would outweigh the marginal cost.




Everybody has essays and projects and crap this week. Me? Nothing. I love AP.




Oh yeah, here's my Christmas list, for those who have been asking:



    
*   
    
    Spiderman 1 and 2 DVD's
    
    
*   
    
    Evil Dead Trilogy DVD box set (noticing a theme yet?)
    
    
*   
    
    Nice headphones (wireless would be cool, but anything better than the crappy
    ones I have)
    
    
    





Maybe I'll add stuff later. Ciao!
