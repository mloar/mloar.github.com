Well, today has sucked. I got up at 8 (after staying up really late working on
my Linux box. Linux sucks. I replace my stupid NIC and I have to rebuild the
kernel) and drove over to Kyle's (I had agreed to drive him to go give blood).
Once there, I called him on the phone, and he's like, "Let me get some pants
on." So I waited while he dressed and ate breakfast, and then we set out for
Westmont. But he didn't even know where we were going, just that it was in
Westmont. I got him to Westmont, and then he called his mom. She gave us an
address, but when we went looking for it, we ended up in Oak Brook. So we set
out for the one in Glen Ellyn, only to find that that one's closed on Fridays.
Then he suggested we go to Panera Bread for lunch. I so should have made him
buy me lunch for my trouble, but I didn't. Then after I dropped him off, I
barely made it to the gas station on the gas my mother had assured me was
sufficient for my journey. When I got home, I discovered that Chris's
invitation had come back to me, due to the problem of what town he lives in,
which I thought I had corrected in the database, but apparently didn't. Worse
than that, the VP Post Office, instead of simply returning the letter to me as
undeliverable, sent it to Carol Stream, where it was postmarked and promptly
returned to Villa Park, wasting the stamp. How nice. It's not even 1 o'clock
yet...
