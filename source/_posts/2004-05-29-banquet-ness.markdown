OK, I'm actually writing this on June 6\.




OK, so I went after school with Nina to set up. We didn't have the right
tables because we didn't put in a set-up request, so Nina and I went to talk
to the grumpy old guy. We got the tables.




I went home to change, and I was late, but it was OK, because lots of people
were late, not that many showed up, and the food wasn't ready.




Nobody wanted to read from the script, which screwed everything up. I totally
bombed my little speech.




I got girly glasses and a Best Buy gift card as parting gifts. Everybody loves
me!




Afterward, I went to see Shrek 2 with Renee, Megan Butler, and Amy Delpercio.




And that's the way it was.
