So I didn't end up going to a movie theater. When I stepped outside, it was
pouring rain. If it doesn't rain all of the time in Seattle, you wouldn't know
it from the past week.




So I spent the time here, in Sammamish, watching the remaining tv shows on my
hard drive and playing GameCube games with my roommate and one of our intern
neighbors. To top it off, twix was unresponsive for a while. It seems to be
fixed now, and I hope it stays that way.
