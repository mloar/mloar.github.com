Well, today was interesting. We were expected to make "presentations" at Fed
Camp, even though many of the people there had never even taken an economics
course. It got out early. Actually, they let us out for our scheduled break,
and everybody else from Willowbrook left, but I stayed. It didn't last that
long after that, but I had to run to catch the 2:40 train. The rest of the
gang was surprised to see me. Anyway, I got home, and I managed to get the
computer started, though I'm not quite sure how. I took out the ATX form card,
so I have no mouse. At least I don't have to be anywhere tomorrow, so I can
stay up late and troubleshoot. Right now though, I'm working on backing up all
of my files. Ah, the wonderful world of computing...
