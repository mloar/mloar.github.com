last weird encounter: I don't really have weird encounters, since I don't
really leave the house much




last time amused: everything amuses me. That's why people think I'm strange.
I'll just be sitting there, and all of the sudden I start laughing.




last time hugged: Gee, I can't really remember. Maybe it was when Matt C.
insisted on hugging me when he paid his surprise visit

answers. It's not my fault you're asking the wrong questions."




last time dancing: does it have to be with a partner? If so, then probably
Turnabout last year. Otherwise, I was trying to tap dance at Parent-Teacher
conferences on Monday, and that's when I learned that Tina is a tap-dancer. I
never would have learned this if I wasn't so silly, so take that all of you
non-silly people! Ha!

really hang that up."
