Yes! My new Dell shipped today! Yay!




I needed a new computer to install Visual Studio .Net, which I need to work on
a project for SIGWin, part of ACM. It's going to be great.




This weekend is Circle K Leadership Training Conference, in good ol' Streator,
IL. Yay, Streator!




Have I told everybody about Econ 302? Anyway, I'm taking it this semester. I
originally was taking it as part of my app sequence, but I found out that the
new CS curriculum, which I supposedly will be able to switch to next year,
eliminates the app sequence. So I thought I could do an econ minor, but I
found out there is no econ minor. It's too late to drop it, so I'm taking it
for no reason. But it's OK. It's the only class I aced the first midterm in.
Plus, I learned partial derivatives a month ago, and we just did them last
week in Calculus. I also learned the Lagrange method of constrained
optimization, which we just did today. I wouldn't have gotten it had it not
been for Econ. So I'm happy.




Other than that, not much is happening.
