I'm following through on my goal of releasing the first version of my Tunez replacement this weekend. Behold Neztu 0.1, a very early version. As a test, I deployed it at ACM. This uncovered a few bugs, which I fixed. Its featureset is still quite limited, and deployment is somewhat involved, but I wanted to get it out there in the hope that people might look at it and offer feedback or even patches.




You can find Neztu on the new [Neztu][0] page.
