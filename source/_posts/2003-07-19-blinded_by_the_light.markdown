Well, today was fun. First thing, I replaced all of the Harveys' outdoor
lighting. Then I spent some time trimming the bushes with a hedge trimmer.
Living in Brandywine where all the landscaping is done by the maintenance guys
in their shiny white trucks makes me all too eager to wield electric hedge
trimmers. Then I got to see Pirates of the Caribbean. It was great, certainly
a lot better than The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Next on my list of
movies to see is Johnny English. C'mon, "Bean meets Bond?" It has to be good.
For those of you who care about this sort of thing, you should know that Rowan
Atkinson had a role as a serious character (silly, but serious) in Never Say
Never Again, the unofficial Bond movie with Sean Connery. That one was even
dumber than The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Anyway, when we got back
from the movie, two of the lights weren't working. I spent about an hour
working on one of them, but to no avail. I still might go out tonight and see
if I can get the other working. Argy!
