I finally got a decent set of software pages up at this site. There are still
a number of things that I need to do, such as play with the style sheets a
little more so it doesn't look so much like Russ's site, possibly flatten the
directory structure of the software archives, and set up a subversion
repository with everything in it. But at least I've started.




I also started redirecting various things at wipt.org here or back to ACM. I
intend to put up a page here at some point simply to document what's there and
to state that the project is pretty much dead.




I also need to start thinking about what to do about this blog. I would very
much like to purge PHP from my life, but that's easier said than done. Since
Dreamhost has FastCGI support, I have been looking at perhaps moving to a
Python blog system. I found a [list][0] on the Python wiki. Of those, I think
that [PyBlosxom][1] looks the most promising. It uses flat files for storage,
so it would be analogous to the [spin][2] software I'm using to build the
software repository. My big hurdle would be importing all of my existing
posts. I have managed to preserve through two moves all of the blog entries I
have ever made, and I don't want to lose that. At the very least, though, I'm
going to work harder at organizing the posts on this blog into categories.
