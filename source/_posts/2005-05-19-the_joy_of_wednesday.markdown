So I actually got up before noon to work today. Guy had both viruses AND
spyware out the wazoo. That's what happens when you use file-sharing programs!
Anyway, I made some moolah. My boss gets back tomorrow, so hopefully I'll be
able to rack up some more hours before the pay period ends.




I finished putting together the new [I-I Circle K site][0]. Hopefully I'll be
going to see Star Wars tomorrow or Friday.




Still dreading getting my grades.
