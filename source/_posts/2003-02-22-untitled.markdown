BTW, got my ACT score today. I got a 32 composite, which makes me happy. It's
weird. I got, let's see...a 35 in reading, 32 in math, 31 in English, and a 28
in science reasoning. I should have done much better in science, but it's the
last test and I was tired. Like I said, it's a practice. It's still good
enough to get me in just about anywhere, though.
