Want to get a quick entry in before I go back to my homework.




Today we got out at 11:20\. Chris and I went to Lumes for brunch, then dropped
off those cards we made at Key Club weeks ago. Then we went to his house and
did the chemistry, but all of that wonderful extra time was squandered playing
Madden on his Xbox. Oh well.




I'm almost done with my Grendel Major Works Data Sheet. Have to meet with Mr.
Blair on Friday.




I shall also have to have a conversation with Mr. Verthein. His
micromanagement is not helping.




And no Mary, though I'm sorry to say it, I don't have a girlfriend. I have
started talking to a certain somebody more often, though.




Well, back to the psycho monster book.
