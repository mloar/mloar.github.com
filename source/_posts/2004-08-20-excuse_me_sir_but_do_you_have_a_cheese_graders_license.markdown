I was looking at Wisconsin business info today, and that's one of the things
you need a license for in Wisconsin. Yup. Cheese grading.




In case you didn't know (man, where have you been?), I now live in the Dairy
State. It sucks big time. Really.




Anyway, I've been unpacking so that I can pack again to move to U of I on
Sunday. I took a break to test the games I bought on Saturday. While we were
in West Lafayette, Chris talked me into buying myself three GameCube games. I
expressed interest in buying a new copy of 007 NightFire for $19.95, so of
course the guy tells me that if I buy 2 pre-owned games, I get another one
free. Chris then tells me that I "have" to have Skies of Arcadia for $26.95\.
Then my freebie is NCAA Football 2004, for $17.95, the same price as the pre-
owned 007 NightFire. Anyway, I ended up getting all three games. I like 007
NightFire, and spent several hours playing it tonight. NCAA Football looks
like a lot of fun too, especially in the dorm. But Skies of Arcadia is 1) an
RPG, which I don't really care for; 2) confusing; and 3) missing its manual,
unlike the other two games, and this is one game you want the manual for.




So there it is. I am so glad that Chris is in Indiana, so he can't convince me
to waste any more of my own money.




So after I got really sleepy playing 007, I logged on to check email and catch
up on everybody's blog. Then Denise IMed me about some Key Club stuff, and
told me that she has something to give me, but of course, I'm in frickin'
Wisconsin. Did I mention Wisconsin sucks?




P.S. I also really miss my cable modem. Dial-up sucks!
