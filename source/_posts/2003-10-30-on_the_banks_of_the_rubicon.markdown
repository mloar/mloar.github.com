I have to get some junk done and then get to bed, so here is the recap of my
day:



    
*   
    
    Forgot the Food Drive envelope at home. Oops.
    
    
*   
    
    Did fun chem lab with CBL. Go, technology!
    
    
*   
    
    Pretty sure I got correct answer to Calc test take-home problem. Mrs.
    Butler said that the tests were good, so I am hopeful.
    
    
*   
    
    Rest of day pretty routine.
    
    
*   
    
    Got envelope and did food drive. (Crap, I still have to email an
    announcement to Mr. V. It doesn't matter, he said he wouldn't be able to get
    it in until Friday anyway.) Meeting tomorrow. Lots of people, a number of
    cans, good times! Even Chris came to help out. Rock on, Chris!

    Matt Cuellar paid me a surprise visit today. Man, has he changed. We
    agreed we must get together sometime and get Chinese food.
    
    
*   
    
    Had interview with MIT guy. It went pretty well.
    
    
*   
    
    Now I have to get junk done, especially get started on English and Econ
    papers due Friday. The latter I have to fortunate coincidence to have to
    collaborate with Bonnie on. Actually, Bonnie and I are in the same group for
    the former as well. Weirdness, but GOOD weirdness.
    
    
    





Well, that ends the recap. Tune in tomorrow for another dose of masochism.
