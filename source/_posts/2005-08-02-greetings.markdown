Well, it's August 1st.




I spent last night stressing over the Linode. I had to pay for another month
today. The filemanager still doesn't work right, and I still don't have a way
to manage Mailman through the control panel.




I suppose that I could use it for something else, but what? It costs SamAMac
$21 a month on top of the $10 for the reseller account.




The account the I-I has with Hostway sucks. They're running this really old
version of PHP, and I can't use temporary tables in mySQL. It totally sucks.




Plus, Illinexus is losing its hosting. I don't know what they're requirements
are, and they could just get their own Linode, anyway.




Anyway, today is Monday. My CS 273 assignment is due tomorrow. I went to
office hours, but I wasn't able to get much help. Office hours are pretty
pointless. If they couldn't explain it in class, why would they be able to
explain it later?




I've been hanging out in the ACM office since class got out at 10\. Clausen was
able to get the Vista beta from MSDN. I'm working on installing it now.




Anybody want to talk? Call my cell.
