Well, today was Reading Day, or the Day Between Classes and Finals When You
Remind Yourself Constantly That You Should Be Studying.




Well, my finals don't start till Tuesday, so I'm not in too much trouble on
that count. But I do need to do some serious studying this weekend.




So today I woke up kind of late. There was an ITAB meeting at 9:30, but I
didn't really feel like going anyway. I sold back my Econ book to the IUB for
$60.25, then my CS book to Follett's for $56 and change (IUB was overstocked).
Then I went to ask my MATH 225 instructor a stupid question just for face
time.




The strangest thing that happened today is that I got a ticket. Of course my
boss gives me the most work when I shouldn't really be doing it. Anyway, I
went out on that job at 2\. Girl's hard drive had a head crash. Called HP and
had the easiest support call ever ("Oooh, head crash. OK, let's send you a new
hard drive..."). Going to install it for her tomorrow. Also meeting with Brian
to go over how the timecard system works. Then, I must study.




I did a bunch of stuff today that I really didn't need to do. Namely, I
_finally_ got Drupal working on the ACM server (Clausen screwed up the config.
Figures). I also upgraded Drupal on the Circle K site.




Oh, and my mouse's battery is now low. Great.
