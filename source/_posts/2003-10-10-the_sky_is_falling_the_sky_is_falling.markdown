The latest of Chicken Little's escapades: [Parents sue school over Wi-Fi][0].




In other news, I'm an AP Scholar. Whoop-de-do!




The meeting went OK, I guess. We actually had some new members there for Key
Club 101, at least. Mr. Verthein is still loading things upon me. I guess that
he felt that this meeting was a little disorganized. I'm going to see if this
is a good opportunity to push parliamentary procedure. I'd love to actually
use it, and our club might just be big enough for it to be appropriate.




I didn't spend much time in class today, since it was Centurion Picture Day.
Mom suggested that I wear my Harvard shirt, and "Harvard" became the
photographer's name for me.




Well, I have to go to a doctor's appointment (Yay). More updates later!




P.S. If you tried to read my blog today and got a picture of a lobster
instead, I have no idea what happened.
