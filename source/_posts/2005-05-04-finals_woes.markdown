So I've decided not to take the optional Econ 303 final, and to just get my b
-hopefully-not-minus. This whole situation angers me because:



    
1.  
    
    It's an Econ class, and I should have done better in it.
    
    
1.  
    
    This class really doesn't do me any good. I took it as part of my
    application sequence only because I needed to extend my app sequence for the
    James Scholar Program, which I have now given up on. Having taken Econ 302
    last semester, I could have taken one 400-level Econ class and been done with
    it. Now I still have to take a 400-level to complete my sequence, and there
    aren't any that require both 302 and 303, so I wasted my time taking both.
    
    
1.  
    
    I'm just generally angry about this whole semester.
    
    
    





At least it gives me that much more time to study for my other 4 finals, so
that hopefully I'll pass all my classes, and it saves me from having to get up
for one 8 AM final, what actually would have been my first one.
