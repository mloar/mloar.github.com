So my matrix theory teacher lets us out early today. That was pretty cool,
since I got to eat lunch before going out on a job.




Then spent the rest of the night trying to make myself productive.




Then I found out that one of the [Millenium Problems relates to finding a
polynomial time algorithm for Minesweeper][0].




So I played Minesweeper, and I got a time on Beginner of...anyone?




42 seconds.
