Well, I finally figured out what the problem with Max was. I had made a huge
tarball of all of my important files on Ziggy, and it took up all of Max's
hard drive. I've also figured out where Max could come from. You see, my other
two towers are named after computers from TV (Ziggy from Quantum Leap and
Sandy from MacGyver). I was trying to come up with one my third, and Mary
suggested Max. Well, I just remembered a TV computer called Max: Max Headroom!
OK, so he wasn't actually a computer so much as a computer program, but hey,
it works.




(My-brain-was-made-for-playing-six-degrees postscript: The voice of Max
Headroom was done by Matt Frewer, who, in addition to playing that character-
whose-name-I-forget on the show, also has appeared in _The Fourth Protocol_,
Episode "A Matter of Time" of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, and is a
regular on _Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal_, a show hosted by Dan
Ackroyd...)
