Econ tests went OK. Meeting was all right too.




I just went to Best Buy because I had this Reward Zone certificate that was
going to expire. So I went in and realized that I had wanted to get a USB hub.
First of all, Abbie had one that she said she didn't need, and I could have
asked her to send it to me, but I decided to buy one instead. Anyway, I picked
out a hub that was $20, $15 after mail-in rebate. Then as I'm going to the
register, I realize that I have a gift card at home on my dresser. But the
certificate is going to expire, it's almost closing time, and I don't want to
run home and come back, so I just went ahead and bought it. But instead of
using my debit card, I used cash, and now I don't have enough to pay Mrs.
Joyce for the pizza tomorrow.




I figure I'll use the gift card sooner or later, but it still irritates me.
I've sent away for this free card holder thing that I get free with these
points I get for filling out online surveys, but it hasn't come yet. Then I'll
be able to take my cards with me, since my wallet is too small for all of
them.




Grrness.
