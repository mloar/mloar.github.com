Stayed home from work again today. It didn't snow any more, but this being Seattle, that didn't mean that most of the roads weren't still covered in ice. At work they had emailed everybody Thursday night to say that there wouldn't be a receptionist in our building, our cafeteria would be closed, the shuttles wouldn't be operating, and the sidewalks would likely be covered in ice. So I stayed home even though SoundTransit did manage to restore the 545 to normal operation.




So I grabbed lunch at Blue Moon Burgers, and then I checked out a new bookstore that opened a little bit ago called [Inner Chapters][0]. They sell (and buy) used books as well as coffee and sandwiches, and it's a cozy, locally-owned establishment. I had a postcard good for 25% off my book purchases, and so I picked up a few books:



    
*   
    
    _A Brief History of Time_ by Stephen Hawking. I've been meaning to pick this up for a while.
    
    
*   
    
    _A Time for Peace_ by Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It's a collection of letters and public statements with an introduction by the same. The interesting thing is that this book was published in 1985, while Gorbachev was still General Secretary and before the fall of Communism and the USSR. It should be interesting to read knowing what ultimately happened.
    
    
*   
    
    _You Can Trust the Communists (to do exactly as they say)_ by Dr. Fred Schwarz. This tome from 1961 is exactly the sort of fearmongering propaganda that the title suggests. Should be an entertaining read.
    
    
*   
    
    _Monarch's Dictionary of Legal Terms._ Not exactly a page-turner, but since I'm planning to purchase a residence soon, a reference of those pesky Latin phrases could prove useful.
    
    
*   
    
    _The Perfect Drink for Every Occasion._ A book of familiar and exotic cocktails spiced with tongue-in-cheek humor.
    
    





So now I should have plenty to read when I'm stuck at home, which is good, because the National Weather Service just put this out:



    
    ..A MAJOR DISRUPTIVE WINTER STORM WILL AFFECT MOST OF WESTERN
    WASHINGTON LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY..
    
    ALONG THE I-5 CORRIDOR NORTH OF TACOMA...INCLUDING SEATTLE AND
    EVERETT...STORM TOTAL SNOWFALL OF 4 TO 8 INCHES IS EXPECTED.
    





Oh, joy.
