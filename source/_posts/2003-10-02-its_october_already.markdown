Wow. I can't believe that it's October already. I also can't believe that
they'll be mailing my progress report, chock full of B's, tomorrow. Yay.




Today went pretty well, with the exception of the evil Calculus test. Even
that wasn't too horrible. I'll probably still end up with a low grade on it,
though. But I'm managing...




Auto went all right. Mr. Elliott started the hour by pointing out that I was
88's Best, making a speech about how he likes it when people of my aptitude
take his class, and then having the class applaud me. Auto doesn't suck so
much anymore.




I realized at the end of the day that I really didn't have much homework
tonight, which is good, because I have stuff to catch up on, not to mention
Key Club. I think I might go to the powder puff game or watch the Cubs game,
though.




I gave one of my MIT teacher evaluation forms to Mrs. Marcyniuk. I have to
give the other to a math or science teacher: I'm thinking Mr. Gerut. At least
I'm planning ahead on this, at least.




Lastly, I want to encourage you all to comment on my blog. I haven't received
any since the 25th, and I'm going through withdrawal or something. Also, check
out the [Italian Ghetto][0].
