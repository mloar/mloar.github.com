Well, last night I did end up going to Blockbuster (the one in Urbana). They
had a 2-disc DVD set of the original BBC miniseries of _The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy_. So far, I've watched one disc, which was 6 episodes. It ended
where the second book ended. The special effects were horrible as I had been
told.




Anyway, after picking up the movie, I went to Schnuck's (24-hour grocery
store; funniest name ever). There I purchased Diet Coke, potato chips, granola
bars, and a loaf of bread. Mmmm, college cuisine.




Tonight I broke down and ordered a pizza for the first time this summer. I
ordered from Pizza Hut, which until today I hadn't thought did delivery. I'm
hoping to contain my appetite and save some for dinner tomorrow. Anyway, I
figure I'll eat pizza and watch the second disc. I haven't accomplished much
so far today, why start now?
