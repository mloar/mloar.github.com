Casino Royale - The first of the James Bond and




arguably best of the James Bond books, but the




worst of the movies. As a film it's a poorly




done spoof, but as a novel it's tightly-




written, suspenseful, and filled with some




surprisingly deep character development. Though




it set the stage for the James Bond franchise,




it's quite different from all the movies. As




Bond, you rely on your wits, luck, and rather




misogynistic charm more than on high-tech




gadgets, and your love-life suffers a tragic




turn of events, the basis for all future




romantic entanglements.

I just read this one a little while ago. It was VERY good.
