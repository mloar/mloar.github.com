Greetings! I haven't posted much lately, have I? I guess I've been too busy
enjoying my weekend. On Thursday night, I went to the Glen Ellyn Art Theatre
with Jen. We managed to find it all right, but as it turned out, Bowling for
Columbine wasn't playing at 9:30\. So Jen chose Frida instead. It was a
horrible film, and I advise everyone not to see it. Jen thought it was good.
Anyway, I managed to find a way home (and by pure luck, I found the secret
underpass I had known about!) and then we spent two hours talking afterward.
Yesterday began with MacGyver, then my mom and I went to my sister Aimee's to
hang out and play Tri-Bond. That game is hard. Today began with MacGyver, and
tonight I'm going to an Evil Olive concert. Ah, life doesn't get much better
than this.
