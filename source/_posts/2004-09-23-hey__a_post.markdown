Okey dokey.




So Tuesday I had the Calc test. It was pretty bad. But I did get to physics
and the TA let me take the quiz. Dror said in lecture yesterday that we would
get the tests back today, but he didn't grade my section's, so I didn't.




Today was the econ test. Equally sucky.




There was another guy that joined our group in Physics lab. It sucked, because
he ended up splitting my group, and he was feeding me bad numbers. Bah!




Tomorrow is Peanut Day. I'm working from 1 to 2\. Then Petey and I might do
stuff.




Anyway, I discovered this thing called the Facebook. I signed up for it
yesterday and started looking for friends, and it turned out that Bonnie had
signed up the very same day. Weird.




I'm just blathering now...
