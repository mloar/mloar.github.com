[Clearly, I rock][0].




Well, I've been hard at work doing nothing today. I finished last week's
personal journal, anyway. Lots of homework and Key Club stuff remain, so I'd
better be getting back to it.




Kyle and I went to Microcenter yesterday. We mostly just wandered around. He
didn't buy much. Blah, blah, blah.




Homecoming is next weekend. Woohoo!




Hmmmm, I need to talk to Mr. Finke about VICA. Hmmmm, I also need to pay Key
Club dues.




Yada, yada, yada.
