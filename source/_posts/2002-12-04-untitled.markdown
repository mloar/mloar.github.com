We beat Addison Trail! It was on the very last question. Them: 271\. Us: 270\.
Talk about tense. I realized the answer to the last question was "Teapot Dome
scandal," so I tried to ring in. But the person had forgotten to reset the
lockout system, so I was beating the button to death. Eventually he relalized
his error and I was able to get my answer in. I forget what the bonus question
was, but we beat Addison Trail 290 to 271\. We lost our other round to Downers
Grove South, but that's not really unexpected. Our team is no 4-2(two
forfeits, plus we beat York in our first match of the season). This is so
cool!
