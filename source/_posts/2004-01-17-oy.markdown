Got up to go to a Calc review today, but when I got there, I couldn't figure
out where it was. It was supposed to be at the parish center at St. A's, but I
couldn't find the door I was supposed to go in, and all the ones I tried were
locked. I finally just gave up and came back home. That sucked.




I finished watching Evolution again today. I love that movie.




I'm going to get some studying done today, but otherwise I'm free. Anyone
planning on doing anything?
