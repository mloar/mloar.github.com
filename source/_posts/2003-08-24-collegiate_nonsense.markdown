In case you missed it, here is Jen's email. Of course, this is my blog, so I
had to annotate it.




\_ There are three kids from Willowbrook- Libby Marcowitz, Caleb Reese, and
Diane Reyes. Everyone else is intimidating. \_




Wow, three people from Willowbrook. At least you know some people. I doubt
that I'll know anybody at whatever college I end up at. I'll probably just
have to befriend the IMSA kids.




\_ My roommate is Roxanne. She's from California, San Francisco (which makes
that song about San Francisco run though my head all the time)\_




Which song? The one by Scott MacKenzie? "When you're going to San
Francisco..." That one? That's a cool song.




\_ Attached to my dorm is a seminary (oh, to be in Catholic college) which is
completely odd for someone who went to public school her entire life.\_




It could be worse. Could you imagine going to the "Catholic University of
America?"




\_ My computer, brand new and bought by me, is shiny and useless and even more
intimidating than my classmates.\_




Your computer cannot possibly be more intimidating than mine. And I built
mine.




\_ Classes start on Monday and one of my classes is in a building which does
not actually appear to exist.\_




Which class?




\_ My room number (by the way, as of now, my phone doesn't actually work, in
the sense that we have no dial tone, but hopefully that will sort itself out
soon) is 1-773-**_-_\***\_




Are you sure the phone is plugged in?




\_ My cell is still 630-**_-_\*** and I get reception everywhere on campus
except by this one building and by my dresser (only my dresser) in my dorm. \_




Obviously, your dresser is possessed. You should burn it at the first
opportunity.




\_ My email is **@luc.edu and my regular email is obviously _\*@yahoo.com (write
to either) and my screen name is \*__\*__\*_**, although I doubt I'll go on AIM
until my computer is less evil.\_




I'm sure your computer is not evil, unless, of course, it runs Linux. No one
without proper training in Computer Exorcism should attempt to use it. At MIT,
all of the computers run Linux, because they're a good deal responsible for
creating it. Which I guess means MIT is the source of all evil. Now I want to
go there more than ever!




Have fun Jen!
