Does anyone else find it ironic that Micro Center uses dot-matrix printers and
tractor-feed paper for their receipts?




Didn't go to Jen's party today, because my mom had this big stink about going
if I hadn't received an invitation. According to Renee, a lot of the
invitations weren't mailed. Bummer, really.




Got MS Money 2004 Small Business today. Now I can keep track of all the money
that my business isn't making.




Kyle IM'ed me today. Now I realize how nice it was when he was never online,
but it looks like he'll be on more often now. Shucks.




Going to Boston on Wednesday. Where did summer go?
