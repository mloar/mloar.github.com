Everybody's a critic.




First funny thing: today was Petey's birthday. His younger sister, who's a
dean runner, came in with brownies and sang the strangest version of "Happy
Birthday" I have ever heard. Then we all enjoyed brownies. Yay.




English sucked. Mr. Blair complained about people complaining about his class.
I remember when we had the 1st quarter interview, he complained to me that our
class was a "whiny class."




CBE was OK. We're reading _Catcher in the Rye_. Just kill me now.




At lunch, the wonder twins came to ask me for help with Calculus. What is
wrong with the world?!?!?




Petey's sister made a reappearance in Calculus. More brownies to help us take
our tests. Test was OK.




What can I say about programming? It's fun. Kinda. You know, fun as in "easier
than Auto and I can do homework for other classes, plus I get to write
programs."




Auto was fun. We'll be starting the tires lab soon.




Econ was standard Econ.




We lost to Downers North. No surprise, but we played pretty badly, too. Phil
didn't get either Presidents question, and Kevin didn't do so well on math. At
least Proviso West saved us the hassle of whooping their posterior by not
showing up. Then on the bus Mr. Gerut suggested I make some kind of speech
when Mrs. Joyce got on, but when she did I didn't have much opportunity. Then
Kevin's like, "Great speech." Oh well, I don't care. We're having a practice
on Monday (yay, post-season!) and I'll make it then, after I've had time to
prepare and I'm not so tired. We had pizza as promised, and my tongue still
hurts from the incredibly and deceptively hot cheese.




I have homework to do. Bye.
