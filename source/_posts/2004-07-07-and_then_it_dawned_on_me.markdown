I just realized something...




I wrote a little bit ago about my Blogger profile being the first hit for Matt
Loar on Google.




But that means that anyone who Googles me can now find my blog.




Great, now there won't be ANYONE who hasn't read my blog.




Oh well. I've learned to like not holding stuff back, all bottled up. I've
also learned to like asparagus, but that's a different story.
