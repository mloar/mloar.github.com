So yeah, testing. I had tested my gssapi-keyex support against Sun SSH. Testing against OpenSSH revealed some issues:



    
*   
    
    Group exchange was totally broken. Sun SSH doesn't appear to support group exchange.
    
    
*   
    
    The hash H was improperly computed if the server omitted the optional SSH\_MSG\_KEXGSS\_HOSTKEY message. Sun SSH apparently sends this message.
    
    
*   
    
    Also, rekeying was broken.
    
    





Now I have tested all three kexes against both Sun SSH and OpenSSH, and tested that rekeying works.




You can find the updated version on the [PuTTY][0] page.
