Well, it looks like I'm going to the game alone. Poor me.




It has come to my attention that the technology department at WB doesn't know
diddly-squat about proper computer maintenance/usage. And they wouldn't let me
work there last summer. Bah!




Apparently, this year the school is using edline.com. I just logged into the
account I created today. Interesting.




AMD is up 14.2%. Coolness.




Registered today. School sucks. Got lock on locker before books pulled a
Houdini.




Boston update to come tonight. Black Sheep Airlines renamed The Freedom Press.
Template change coming. Considering creating domain for Italian Ghetto.




Had an idea while walking home today that would have been really cool, had I
been appointed Tech Chair. Foolish Simko. Don't mess with the Gooshiemeister.
