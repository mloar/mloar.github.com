Well, I woke up late, figured out why my internet wasn't working (they change
it over the summer so that you have to use the VPN client), got my new phone
number, and almost finished cleaning this place up. Oh, and I watched
MacGyver.




Later I made myself some soup, watched the last JAG and the episode of Numbers
I missed. Fixed my friend Sanders' internet. Now I'm watching TJ Hooker as I
work on the I-I Circle K site.




What a life.
