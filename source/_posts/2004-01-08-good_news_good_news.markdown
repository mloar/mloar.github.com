Guess what? We're now 8-2 in scholastic bowl. One meet left, against Downers
Grove North (currently undefeated) and Proviso West (currently winless). This
is the best that WB has done in a long time.




Plus, Bonnie won a $10,000 scholarship and an all-expense paid trip to DC to
speak at an awards ceremony. Congratulations, Bonnie!
