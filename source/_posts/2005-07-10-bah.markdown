OK, so here's the deal.




Late last night, I get an email from Clausen. Somebody exploited the XML-RPC
vulnerability in Drupal, which I had installed on the ACM server. Even better,
drupal.org was down. It's still down, actually. They've been trying to reach
their web host for two days. Anyway, at least the server wasn't actually
compromised. I'm on \#drupal at the moment, and one of the main developers got
rooted.




Bah, humbug.
