Yeah, so if you haven't heard, I bombed the Calc test. I wasn't alone, though.




Anyway, I love physics. The exam is tomorrow. First, it's multiple choice.
Second, I went to the review session tonight, and I was delightfully surprised
to see that Professor Liss himself was there. The review session for Econ was
run by the TA, and there was no review session for Calculus.




In other news, I found out that my CS 173 teacher isn't a professor. I grew
suspicious when she sent me to her office to get the graded homework for my
class and her i-Card said "Graduate." That really angers me, because she makes
us do all of this crap (I just realized I missed another Proof of the Day,
oops), and sometimes during lecture she doesn't know what she's talking about.
She tried to convince a room full of programmers that 7=3 mod 4\. Ironically,
the very next day I was in my physics discovery course, and Professor Hubler
used the modulo operator, and he used it correctly, 3 = 7 mod 4\. I have that
exam Sunday (conflict exam, the regular exam is scheduled (of course) Tuesday
night).




I've decided to use my 1,500 weekly Cafe Credits exclusively for Diet Coke,
since it's a pain to carry it home from Walgreens, and then just buy food at
Walgreens. I bought a bunch of stuff tonight, and I hope it will last a while.




I'm ticked off about this one thing I got with my books. It's an access code
for an online thing that Dror doesn't use. It's too late to return it, and I
don't think I could sell it back, especially since I opened it thinking there
was a CD inside. It was $26.50!




Anyway, I gotta get to bed.
