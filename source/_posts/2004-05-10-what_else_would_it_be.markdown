OK, I just told ING to transfer $100 from my savings to my checking account,
since I'll need to get some cash for the prom ticket. Guess what my
confirmation number was. Yup, that's right. 42\.




It's a bummer. I haven't taken any money out since I put the $300 in when I
opened the account. I was hoping I wouldn't have to. But I'm going to need
that $85 hopefully within a couple of days, that ATM deposit still hasn't
cleared (I'll call the bank on Tuesday if it doesn't clear tomorrow), and my
checking is getting lower than I like it to be.




Well, Mom told me tonight that GFS is hiring, so I'm going to get over there
sometime this week and fill out an application. I really need to start
building up my savings, both for college and so that I can pay the filing fee
for the Articles of Incorporation. BTW, anyone want to be the registered
agent? I'm not sure who I should put down for it. All it entails is getting
some important mail from the Secretary of State. Let me know.




I've been working on a new ordering system for the SamAMac site. Hopefully in
a week or so I'll be able to automatically set up accounts as well as register
domain names, which will be totally cool.




Well, it's late. I can't sleep, but it's still late. Maybe I'll do a token
Calculus problem before attempting to sleep again.
