So I was both happy and irritated to find two boxes outside my apartment door this evening: happy because it meant I got to spend the night playing Guitar Hero III on my new Wii, and irritated that UPS had left them to sit in the hallway all day. How come they _sometimes_ know to take things to the leasing office? Oh well.




So yeah, Wii. Lots of fun. I'm picking up Guitar Hero pretty quickly. Now I just need to pack up and do something with my superceded GameCube, and of course pick up all of the packing detritus. Now I know why Wiis are so hard to come by - it must take forever to wrap each individual piece in foam and seal it with green tape. :)




Last night was the last night of the regular bowling season. My team won the first quarter, so we'll be at the championships next week. Need to bring my A game.




And here it is 01:30 and I'm still awake. Something tells me I'm not going to be at the demo day in the morning. Oh well.
