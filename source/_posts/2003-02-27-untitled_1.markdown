Greetings! I haven't posted in a couple of days. Yesterday in Spanish, Brian
asked me if I was the valedictorian. I calmly informed him that:



    
1.  
    
    It's only our junior year,
    
    
1.  
    
    We have percentiles, not rank, so there will be no valedictorian, and
    
    
1.  
    
    I don't know which percentile I'm in.
    
    
    





Brian then asked Josie if she was valedictorian. A puzzled "no" was her reply.
Then Kirby asked if I had ever not gotten an A for a semester grade. Recalling
my B in Spanish last year, I answered, "Yes." At this point, Mr. I (the Mr. I
that gave me the B) starts snickering. I turn around, look at him, and almost
say, "NO COMMENTS FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY!!!" Thankfully, I didn't. But he
still gloated about being the "GPA-buster." That's why his tenure needs to be
revoked.




Today went well. No homework tonight, and no school Friday! There's a Key Club
board meeting tonight that I'm going to get ready for soon. Life is good.
