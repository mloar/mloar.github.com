Early dismissal today. No time for Mrs. Butler to give calculus homework. Rock
on.




Went to Open House to supervise. Prediction made last year about NHS
encroaching on Key Club proves prophetic. Must defeat evil organization. Or
maybe join 'em.




Got back and had email from Princeton Review. Interesting \#4 on list of
[colleges where "Their Students (Almost) Never Study"][0]. Also, \#1 on ["Their
Students Never Stop Studying"][1].




Still have AP Chem homework to do. I am masochism incarnate.
