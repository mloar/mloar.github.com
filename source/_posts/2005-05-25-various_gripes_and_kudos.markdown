Well, I'm going to say it.




I'm not so crazy about Google.




Yep, that's right. There are a few reasons for this. First, I've found out
that Google uses DMOZ, the most useless human-edited directory on the web, as
a crutch for its web results. As a result of this, my brief stint as a DMOZ
editor has resulted in my empty DMOZ bookmarks list to be replicated around
the web, and Google has indexed it a hundred times. Now if you search Google
for "SamAMac" the results are absolutely useless. Google also does not seem to
understand that that if a page has the exact same URL as a previously-indexed
page, it should replace that page in its cache, not place them both in there.
Also, it doesn't agree that maybe if I search for "samamac", it should list
"samamac.com" before "samamac.com/hosting."




Now if we go over to the new [MSN Search][0] and search for SamAMac, the first
hit is...samamac.com! And then an indented link to another page on
samamac.com, followed by a link that says something like "See more pages at
samamac.com." Brilliant! Also, MSN has the ability to get an RSS feed for a
specific search result.




Speaking of RSS, I just found this new thing called [Plogress][1]. It mines
data from THOMAS, the legislative information system, and gives you a feed of
what your elected representatives are doing. Cool, huh?
