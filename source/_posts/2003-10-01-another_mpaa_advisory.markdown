My life is rated PG.




[What is your life rated?][0]"




Today kinda sucked. OK, it really didn't suck, but it wasn't very good,
either. I mean, on a scale of 1 to 10...




Got my National Merit app turned in, along with my MIT form for Mrs. PiÃ±a.
Got to get my brag sheet in, and distribute my teacher recommendations. Got my
Senior Interview done at the same time, so I should be getting a copy of my
transcript to finish filling these forms out in the mail.




Getting a 76% in chemistry. By her new grading scale, that's a B.




Auto kinda sucks.




I have a lot of Key Club junk to do, in addition to all of the other random
junk I have to do.




Yeah.
