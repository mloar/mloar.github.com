Good stuff that happened today:



    
*   
    
    I finished the chem lab by myself easily.
    
    
*   
    
    I helped Bonnie out a little with her lab.
    
    
*   
    
    Kevin asked for me for help in Programming.
    
    
*   
    
    Finished the engine top end in Auto.
    
    
*   
    
    The meeting ran pretty well since Chris wasn't there.
    
    
    





Bad stuff that happened today:



    
*   
    
    Bonnie was asking people if they wanted to get together over the weekend
    to have a mass chemlab writing-up session. Kevin was included, but I was not.
    Don't know if that was an oversight or what.
    
    
*   
    
    Chris didn't have a newsletter for us.
    
    
*   
    
    Mr. V still got on my nerves, though not as much as usual.
    
    
*   
    
    MIT site shows no trace of recommendation Mrs. M says she faxed days ago.
    
    
*   
    
    I had a good deal of homework, which is still not entirely done as I write
    this. I don't care, though. Tomorrow's Friday, and I'm going to bed.
    
    
    





Good night! I'll have more time tomorrow, so let me know if you want to post
more details about something. Blogging is one of my few leisure activities
these days.
