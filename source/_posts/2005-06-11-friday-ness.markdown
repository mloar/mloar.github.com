Rock on!




I got certificate rules for software restriction policies to work!




For the technically inclined:




\[HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Safer\\CodeIdentifiers\]




"AuthenticodeEnabled" = DWORD:0x000001




Anyway, I'm one step closer to making this into an application and getting
rich. I've already tested the code signing with my SSL server certificate, but
I'm thinking I'd just create my own CA if I really got into this.




Anyway, this morning I had to go to Beckman to test the wireless for the
conference we're providing support for next week. It was kind of ridiculous.
All I did was get on the wide-open network that they had set up. No
authentication, no encryption, and SSID broadcast on (though they're going to
turn that off).




Now I'm trying to figure out what to do tonight. I've already eaten every bit
of food in the care package that I got yesterday, and I'm out of Diet Coke
again. I'm thinking Blockbuster, but it's nearly a mile away, and it's been
raining on and off.




Oh well.
