It sets in. My current sleep schedule is about 17:00 to 9:00\. Yay.




Last night Jacky and I went to dinner at Fazoli's and ended up seeing Shrek
the Third. The franchise is losing steam, but it was still a great picture, a
lot better than Spiderman 3\. And we got to see ACM's own Don Schmidt in the
credits at the end.




Also, I finally got one of those cards. They put it in the mailbox for the
vacant unit next to mine for some unfathomable reason. Anyway, we have omega
back up at ACM now.




A while back I subscribed to the new Napster. I really like it, but I was
disappointed that I couldn't get my SMT5600 Smartphone, which was listed as a
supported mobile device, to work with it. The Napster software didn't detect
it upon connection as it was supposed to. Tonight, however, I got the great
idea to try using Windows Media Player. You see, Napster uses Microsoft's
PlaysForSure DRM technology, and I had been using WMP to play the songs I had
downloaded off of Napster offline. Sure enough, WMP detected my device and
successfully transferred the tracks with licenses to my Smartphone, so now I
can use it to listen to my music. That's one thing I have to say, MS stuff
tends to work with other MS stuff.




Right now I'm doing some work while watching one of the Blockbuster Online
DVDs that has been sitting on my TV for weeks. I have quite a bit of work to
get done, and quite a bit of money owed me to collect. I need to start bugging
some people.
