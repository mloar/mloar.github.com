Ah, peachiness. Yesterday at lunch, [Jen brought up "us."][0] While expecting
this, I was totally unprepared. I don't like the way I left it. To be
perfectly honest, I'm just a little nervous. I have no experience in this
area. I totally agree that the next move is mine, though.




In other news, Kirby came over to the table twice yesterday inquiring about my
GPA. It's her assertion I'm the highest ranked in our class. I doubt it,
though.




Got my Pre-Calc test back today. I actually managed to get a 91%. I don't know
if that will swing me an A for the quarter, though. I also got a 66/70 on the
Spanish quiz. I think either Jen or Mary is working on Jen's blog as I write
this.




I have some lovely Pre-Calc and stats to do tonight, not to mention spending
some time thinking about my research paper. JAG's a rerun. School sucks. I
also have to write a little speech to give at the Key Club meeting tomorrow.
We had to move it to Wednesday because of a faculty meeting.




I'd better stop blogging and get to work. Sigh...
