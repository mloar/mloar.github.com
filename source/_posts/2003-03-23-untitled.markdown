[Be afraid, be very afraid.][0]




Well, Jen hasn't posted yet, so I guess I'll be first this time. We went to
the York Theatre (I gave her directions) to see _Chicago_. It was all right, I
guess. It's just that the actual movie was only about 15 minutes long. The
rest of it was having silly song and dance numbers instead of actual dialogue.
I thought it was bad, even for an artsy film (measured against _Frida_ and
_Run Lola Run_). Then we came back here, and didn't spend too long in front of
my door, for a very good reason. It's not as secluded as Jen's, and my parents
and sister came out at one point.




I told her about my coffeehouse dream. She didn't think it was interesting.




I have 25 notecards and some statistics due Monday, and I'm going to my sister
Aimee's tomorrow. At least this is the last week before spring break. But over
spring break I have to write two research papers, one in spanish, and take a
crash course in how not to make a fool of myself at caucases. Sigh...
