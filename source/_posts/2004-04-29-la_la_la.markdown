Okey dokey.




Went in to school to give Mr. Blair the scholarship thingy. He said he was
looking into getting my satire essay published in _Atlantic Monthly_.
Coolness. Also picked up my transcripts.




Went to VP Bank Scholarship dinner. It was a lot of fun. I think I had the
funniest speech. Also found out I was the "1st Alternate." I guess that means
that if any of the winners have a mysterious accident...




Also found out that the VP Kiwanis are giving me $750\. Yay! Now I have
something to put on my senior poll thingy.
