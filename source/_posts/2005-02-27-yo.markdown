So I got my tax refund direct deposited today. Beauty. I also found out that
since I'm a student working for the University, I'm exempt from FICA and
Medicare taxes. Joy. So I spent 99 cents on "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" by
Green Day. Best. Song. Ever.




Finally heard from my first client from work yesterday. Still haven't set up
an appointment, which means I won't get paid for this job until the next pay
period. Bummer.




Today we're having an online meeting for SIGWin at 3\. I've been up since 10 or
so for some reason, so I've been bored.




Somebody needs to come visit me. Or better yet, somebody needs to buy me a car
so I can come visit them.




All of my classes are going pretty well. Well, except for Diff Eq. And Matrix
Theory. And Econ, sorta. But other than that...




So the CS Department accepted my project for CS Days. It's a program that will
gather data from the occupancy sensors and e-locks, and produce a sort of
radar display on the video wall. Cool, huh?




I'm bored.
