Mary has informed me that SamAMac Incorporated has received a bill from the
Illinois Department of Revenue. This wasn't totally unexpected. I sent in our
tax return late and suspected that IDOR would charge us a penalty. What I
didn't expect, however, is that they would send us a bill for $0.00\.




I think I'll send them a check for $0.00\.
