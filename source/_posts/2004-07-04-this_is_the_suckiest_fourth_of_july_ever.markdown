It's raining. A lot.




So here's what's been going on:

    Last night Chris, Jen, and I went down to the Taste of Chicago. I had
    wanted to go tonight when there are fireworks, but now I'm glad I went last
    night, because it rained today. We stayed at the Taste until it closed and
    then came back to my house and watched Goldfinger.

    Today I went up to Wisconsin with my parents to look at houses. We found
    one we liked and put a bid on it, but somebody beat us and they accepted the
    other offer. Day now officially wasted.

    We spent some time at my sister Aimee's house, and then Dad and I came
    back home. It was raining until a little while ago. Nothing to do.

    Tomorrow I have to serve Mass at noon, and then I think the plan is to go
    back to Aimee's. Fun.

    I start work on Tuesday, so my weekdays will be spoken for for the rest of
    the summer. Yay.
