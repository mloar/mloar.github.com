This sucks. Halloween is on a Friday, but I have to take the SAT II Saturday
morning. Oh well. I'm going to find SOMETHING to do.




Key Club is seriously sucking. I'd do something about it, but this is the
worst time ever, since it's the end of the quarter. I'll get stuff done next
weekend, when we have 4 days. I've decided that it's going to take some more
executive decisionmaking, though. There's not enough time to leave everything
to the board. I also have to work on the online resources...




I still have to finish my English and Econ essays. Make that "start." Sigh...




Bonnie came to ask me for help with Econ at lunch today. Coolness.




Just one more day, and then I can blow everything off. Who cares about the SAT
II, anyway?
