I'm still up so I thought I'd jot down a few notes.




So it occurs to me that I didn't post about my grades this semester. Yeah, I
got 'em. I'm not sure whether or not dropping CS 421 last semester got me
anywhere, as the result this semester was a C-. But hey, I'll take it.




I failed CS 473, dammit. That brings spring semester's total to 16 hours and
three previously-failed classes (well, technically I failed MATH 461 and am
taking MATH 463, but close enough).




The "easy" security class: B+. For a class I attended 4, maybe 5 times, I'm
not about to complain too loudly.




And I was not misinformed about Ralph Johnson's propensity for easy grading as
I received an A in CS 492\. I don't think any work has been done on the project
so far over break, but that's near the top of my to-do list for next week.




I think that next semester is the semester I start regularly attending class
again. Yeah, that would probably be a good idea. I'm also going to push to get
the new admins doing stuff so that Nick and I can focus on graduating.




In other news, I need to find a solution to the SamAMac problem. I need to get
rid of it and move on with my life, but don't quite know how. Any suggestions?
