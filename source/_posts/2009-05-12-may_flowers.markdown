It has been a while since I made a personal post. I'm fully moved out of my
apartment and mostly settled into my new condo. I'm slowly getting everything
put away. I have numbers for a couple of interior decorators, and I intend to
consult one on what colors would work well for my living room. But before I do
that, I want to really get my place squared away. I'm very glad that I asked
the seller to leave behind the pantry-type thing in the kitchen - there is very
little cabinet space and it is very useful. The thing in the bedroom I asked
him to leave is a lot less useful, however. It looked very wrong where it
wasplace, so I pulled it out of the bedroom and it is currently out in the
living room on its side supporting my server machine. I think that it would
probably be best for me to get a real desk for my server and to put my laptop
out there as well. But I am slowly making this place my own, and once I get the
walls painted a consistent color, I plan to have a housewarming party.




Otherwise I have been enjoying my new place. I have set a goal for myself to
sit at every bar in Belltown (a goal which is very difficult to achieve, but
that is kind of the point). Belltown is a great neighborhood, and it doesn't
hurt that a lot of my friends live around here too.
