I finally got over to Best Buy today to buy a new keyboard. The other one had
funny problems with keys not working, plus it was really dirty.




Which leads me to my rant for the day. Why can't there be a standard key
configuration? I mean, there's industry standards for just about everything
else, and this is a real productivity issue. My new keyboard has the backslash
BELOW the enter key. I mean, it's people who work in the computer industry
that actually use that key, so couldn't they decide where to put it? Honestly.




BTW, Mary's having a party tomorrow at 8:30 at her house. I can't be there on
account of orientation, but she asked me to spread the word.
