Today I spent recuperating from cold \#429 and sorting through my personal
possessions. I listed a couple of things on eBay and managed to sell one
already.




I have far too many things that I need to get done. But I don't think I'll
make any progress on them before I get back to Champaign, which will be
Sunday. I very much hope to see everyone this Saturday at Holiday Embrace.




I need to keep up my blog more. If I don't post, yell at me.
