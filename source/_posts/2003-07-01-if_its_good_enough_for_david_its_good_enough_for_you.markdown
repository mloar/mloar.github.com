Well, today has been a long and interesting day. I got the signs for the
parade from my sister and got them to Renee. Jen and Brenda were at Renee's
house, talking to somebody on the phone. I didn't ask questions. I'm going to
International convention tomorrow, so I have to get all ready tonight. I'm
nervous but excited. It's too bad I don't have anybody from my home club
going. Sucks actually. Oh well, rumor has it that Maureen and Anna will be
attending the concurrent Circle K convention, so I hope I'll get to see them
at some point. Mary IMed me tonight to rant about Blogger again, give me the
URL of her new blog (I've updated the link) and tell me to "get at least one
number." The guy at interAdvantage got back to me, and my account with them is
all set. I just have to send them the money, which I'll do as soon as I can
confirm my bank account with stupid PayPal. My notice will be running in the
Lombardian and VP Review this Wednesday (go out and get yourself a piece of
history, I'm finally starting my own business). Other than that, I don't think
I have anything to say. I'm sure I'll have plenty once I get back from
Convention. Ciao!
