Today went fairly well. The Pre-Calc test was terrible. The in-class essay
wasn't too fun either. After Spanish(not bad) Chris begged me to let him copy
my homework. I relented (I guess it's not the first time: I used to let Jen
copy my stats, but now I just sit there and say, "That's ridiculously easy!").
It wouldn't have been so bad, except Mr. Gerut lauded Chris for getting things
right and for actually writing neatly (I didn't have anything to do with
that). Chris told Mr. Gerut that he "had help." I'll say. PE was fun. Then I
came home and actually got some stuff done. I was just trying to decide which
shirt and tie to wear with my new suit. Decisions, decisions.




Oh, and Jen, I had a suit all along. It's not MY fault the western style went
out in the 70's.
