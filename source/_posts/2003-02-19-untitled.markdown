I just showed the poem to Chris. He called it "disturbing." Here it is in
English for all you monolinguists:



    
    Maverick is his name
    and how interesting is this man.
    He has a very big car
    and he lives with his cat and mother.
    
    One day, the guy wrote
    a spanish essay.
    A story, or so it seemed to me
    about a cat in a tree.
    
    Mr. Tinkles was what he was called
    by a girl and her father.
    But my paper was written
    in which I killed the kitten.
    
    But Mr. Tinkles lives
    in my mind and heart.
    And I don't sleep at night
    because I love the rascal.
    
    That cat haunts me
    and I cry when it rains,
    because I know above all
    that Mr. Tinkles is in a tree.
