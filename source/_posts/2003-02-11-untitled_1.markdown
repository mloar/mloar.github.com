Well, this sucks. For AP American History, we have to read this stupid book by
a Marxist historian. It wasn't so bad before, but every chapter is about the
same thing: how those evil capitalists oppressed the masses. I'm all for
egalitarianism, but it gets kind of old by the 10th chapter. It's like, "This
is America, stupid! That's the way it is!" For crying out loud, haven't those
stupid socialists figured it out yet? There will always be class distinctions
in society. These Marxists need to read more Vonnegut. I have to read yet
another 40-page chapter tonight, besides writing my dumb reflection on the
LAST chapter. I also have some other stuff to finish for that class. Sheesh.
Well, hopefully I can finish everything before MacGyver.




Got the report for January mailed. Everything else is peachy. I'm taking the
American High School Math Exam tomorrow(yaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy). I took the ACT
as a practice on Saturday. I was tired, and I had trouble finishing. Oh well.
It's a practice. Hopefully it won't be too bad.




Au revoir.
