Yesterday was a horribly busy day. I won't bore you with all of the details,
but at one point, I was taking resumes for Microsoft. Yeah.




Today won't be much better. Besides two classes, a work meeting, homework due
at midnight and homework due before the professor's administrative assistant
arrives tomorrow morning, I am currently waiting for the UPS man at my
apartment. Hopefully he'll get here before I have to leave.




Anyway, I was looking on the newsgroup for help with one of the problems, and
I found [this link][0]. That's what I feel like doing right now, to be honest.
