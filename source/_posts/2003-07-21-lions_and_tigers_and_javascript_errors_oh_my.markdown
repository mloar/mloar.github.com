I realized that I hadn't posted my AP scores, and I looked to see if anyone
else had. Well, Jen, you just know you made some horrible error on one of
those forms, and now they have to sort it out. Speaking of errors, I noticed
that the usual comment links were nowhere to be found, and IE told me there's
a Javascript error. Guess it's time to call Mary, eh?




But I digress. I was going to post my AP scores for all the world to see:




American History




5




English Composition




4




Statistics




5




I know, it seems like I'm gloating, but hey, what are AP scores for?
