I just got back from my aunt's house. We were finishing the job of rescreening
her deck. Fun fun.




Anyway, I just got an email back from Michelle. One day before our committee
orientation meeting, I find out that she does NOT want to the Scrapbook chair.
Ironic, since she wasn't my first choice for the Scrapbook and my sister said
she would be a good choice. I've already made two promises, so that pretty
much means that Michelle will be the Membership chair, and Caroline and Emily
will be the Scrapbook Chairpersons, like I had originally intended. I still
have not had confirmation from them, so I'm hoping they'll show up tomorrow.
Otherwise, the Scrapbook Committee could end up under the competent leadership
of...well, I'm sure you know. No, I don't think I'd do that. I'd get Nina M.
to do it, depending on her sports schedule. If it so happens that she won't be
playing badminton or whatever in the months leading up to Convention, that
would be perfect. Sigh...I still have to get all of the literature and stuff
ready for tomorrow, and I just remembered that I don't have a black ink
cartridge. Also, I'm out of money. Whatever am I going to do?
