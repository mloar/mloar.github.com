I have a ton of homework tonight. So, in my usual style, I'm still struggling
to get started.




Chris still not in school. Chris still not doing job. Chris probably screwed
on his essay, considering it was due the 5th but he had until the 12th to turn
it in. At least that's how Petey saw it.




MIT mailed decision letters yesterday. Nothing received yet.




Got my listing on CompareWebHosts.com today. Also put live help on SamAMac
site.




Ennsmann's stupid rule about band members being current WB students
endangering Battle of the Bands.




End.
