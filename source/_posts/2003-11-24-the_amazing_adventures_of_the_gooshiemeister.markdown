OK, so here's what happened last night:




-Went to the play. To my surprise, Brian didn't ruin the play. It was ruined
by other actors who couldn't say their lines with the right rhythm (not to
mention singing some of them to the tune of the theme from _Gilligan's
Island_), the insertion of innuendo into even the most innocuous lines, and
the modern/period dress that made it look like _Romeo and Juliet_ meets
_Grease_.




-Walked around talking to people.




-Somehow ended up peeling tape.




-Went to Friday's with the gang plus Trilok and Kelly. Much mischief ensued.
Philly cheesesteak sandwich was good though.




-Suggestion of going bowling became walking around downtown Downers Grove. I
can now add walking through a cemetery at night to my list of life
experiences.




-Came home and watched Wrath of Khan. Again.




Well, there it is.
