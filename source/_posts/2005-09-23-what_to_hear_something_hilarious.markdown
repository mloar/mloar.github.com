So as you may or may not know, every year the Association for Computing
Machinery at UIUC (of which I am a member of the exec board) holds a
conference and gets speakers from companies and academia to come and talk.
Last year we had the founder of Wikipedia and he gave a great presentation.
People come from all over the country to go to this conference.




Anyway, as part of this conference, they always have a job fair. Companies pay
ACM $1000 to have a table.




Well, Anthony, the treasurer, just walked in and said they may have to turn
away some of them. They have 26 interested, and the Atrium can really only
accomodate 21\. Isn't that insane?
