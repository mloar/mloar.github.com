Hello. This is my new blog. I figured that I'd give this a shot. It's been
awhile since I've had a web site of my very own(I maintain one for my school's
Key Club, of which I am secretary, and one for my as-of-yet nonexistent
company). I'll post whatever when I feel the need. Maybe this will compel me
to write more frequently than I do in my journal. Well, it's after midnight
and my statistics homework isn't done(5 lousy days, and I leave it all for
Sunday). Sigh.....
