Wow, I don't think I've ever gotten three comments so quickly before.




I don't think that Mrs. Marcyniuk sent in the MIT recommendation by the
deadline, so I have a feeling that MIT isn't going to process it with the
Early Action batch. That would mean I wouldn't get a decision until March,
which would suck.




I'm actually done with everything that needs to be done by tomorrow, but a lot
of the stuff I had planned on doing this weekend is, of course, not done.




I have to get the Olin recommendations out tomorrow.




Got lots o' Key Club stuff to do too.




Fun fun fun.
