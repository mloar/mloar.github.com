Board meeting went all right. Tended to skew into tangents and took two hours,
but it was fun. Maybe I should start posting board minutes on wbkeyclub.org
too. Hmmm....anyway, Jen had a humorous account of it in her blog. After the
board meeting I went to my bank and the grocery store and I didn't get home
till 10\. I typed the minutes, printed out the Duties of Club Officers bulletin
for tomorrow, and also updated the committee directive sheets for March 6\.
I'll have to post them on the site tomorrow. Tomorrow is the last day before a
4-day weekend. Yay. Maybe I'll finally be able to get some work done. Well, I
really need to get some sleep, so I can beat myself up again tomorrow (I'm in
a saturnine mood tonight). Note to self: make to-do list tonight/tomorrow.
Live long and prosper.
