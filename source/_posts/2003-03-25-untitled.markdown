Hello! Today was pretty good for a Monday. History was kind of fun. Jen was
taking the stat test 5th hour, so she wasn't at lunch. I went to see "Days of
Heaven" after school for extra credit. It sucked. But we had pizza, and lots
of people I knew where there, including Caroline and Anna (not that Anna, if
you know "Caroline and Anna," you know which Anna I'm referring to) Chris
(Lauren's brother Chris, not loud Chris), Ryan A. and Bonnie. Bonnie sat next
to me. Coolness. I got to help Anna with her algebra homework. It was funny. I
walked in and everyone's like, "Anna, ask Matt." It was just how to find the
vertex of a parabola. I like feeling I'm needed.
