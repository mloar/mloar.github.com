Greetings! This is my first post in loooooong time. I doubt anyone still reads
this. Whatever.




So my apartment is very warm. 80 degrees by the thermometer on my wall clock.
I may have to start working from ACM if it stays this hot. My cable modem
connection dying every couple hours doesn't help things either.




Today saw a very abrupt thunderstorm. There were very short bouts of pouring
rain and high winds, but it was over in less than an hour.

the tree that fell across the street from my apartment. It's kind of scary,
actually. It was right behind my driveway, and I had left in my car just about
a half-hour before it happened.




[![The woodchipper guys](http://matthew.loar.name/blog/uploads/IMAGE_076.serendipityThumb.jpg)][1]A half-hour later two guys from the city showed
up with a woodchipper. A little later some firemen came out of the station
next door and stood there watching them chop it up. I found it amusing to see
firemen as the rubberneckers for a change.




Anyway, I have work to do, then there's a new House tonight. Hopefully I'll
get at least one of the HME ethernet cards I ordered tomorrow, so that we can
get some work done at ACM.
