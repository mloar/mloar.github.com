To be honest, I never _really_ left. But ever since I bought a laptop table at IKEA (bearing the model name of DAVE) and moved my laptop into my bedroom, I have been spending a lot less time on computer stuff. It's hard for me to see this as a bad thing.




Instead, I have rediscovered the joy of video games. I finally played through Skies of Arcadia Legends after discovering that I had gotten stuck pathetically early in the game due to a lack of preparation. I then discovered that Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess was available for GameCube, and I ordered it. It has blown me away. The graphics are spectacular, and the gameplay is so much fun.




That said, I haven't totally abandoned my software projects. Last night I got a buildbot set up for Vim. My next project is to add MSI packaging to my buildbots for PuTTY and Vim so that I can update my distributions more frequently. I also have a patch for window position persistence I want to work into my PuTTY branch. It may be a small enough change that they may take it upstream - I don't know. I also want to set up pages for some of the projects that I started but never really completed so that someone else might get some use out of them.




I also am in the middle of transitioning all of my websites and other infrastructure to [Slicehost][0]. Even the smallest slice is pretty awesome.
