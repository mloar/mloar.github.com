Quick recap, because I have chem and a Major Works Data Sheet to do:




-Wednesday: The power went out 5th hour. For some reason, both Dr. Ennsmann
and Dr. Humphrey were out of the building, so there was no one with the
authority to let us go home. Then the lights came back on. It sucked. Then at
the beginning of 6th hour, the fire alarm went off. Turns out somebody pulled
it. Wasn't too bad, though.




-Thursday: Fire alarm during 6th again. Really cold outside. Somebody deserves
to be shot. Then I found out Kevin couldn't get a program that I wrote in 10
minutes a week ago working. I feel smart. Key Club meeting sucked. Nobody
showed up. I announced that all non-attending members should be flogged. Then
Chris suggested that they be defenestrated. I liked his suggestion better. Got
my SAT II scores. Math IIC: 700\. Physics: 720\. Writing: 740\. Coolness.
