So on a whim, I click on the 'Froogle' link on google.com.




And on the Froogle page, they have items that have recently been found, on of
which is 'ketchup.'




And I think, "Who shops for ketchup on the internet?"




So I click it, and the cheapest one is from Amazon.com.




And I think, "Amazon sells ketchup?"




Then I look at the [page][0]. Scroll down to the 'So you'd like to...'
section.
