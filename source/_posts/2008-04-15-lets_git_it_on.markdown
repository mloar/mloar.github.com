That is quite possibly the dumbest title I've ever had for a blog post.




So of course after I bashed git in last night's post, I have started looking at it again. My dismissal of it initially was because of the lack of real Windows support, but that has become less of an issue for me. Also, apparently there is a [native port of git][0] for Windows now though.




Anyway, the first thing I'm going to do is get git 1.5, since it's supposed to be better or whatever. Not surprisingly, etch still has 1.4\. I have been contemplating upgrading my home box to lenny anyway, so I might do that, or I might simply backport it.




Anyway, for what I said about its documentation, the [user manual][1] seems to be comprehensive and decent. It does seem that they reuse standard VCS terms to mean different things, though.




Anyway, I'll report back on how this goes. That nonsense I went through last night just to purge some badly-named branches from my repository may just push me to git.
