Hello. I don't have much time to post tonight (do I ever?). Conference (yes,
it was conference, not regionals) went well. We won one, lost one, and didn't
score enough points to get the wildcard spot. It was a lot of fun, though.
Saturday I'm going to regionals for Willowbrook's nonexistent math team. My
blog appeared to be down earlier, along with some others, it seemed. I got it
back up, though. I've added Jen to my list. Both Jen and Mary are secretive
about the URLs, so I guess I'm being sneaky. Although as far as I know,
they're the only ones that read this. No Key Club meeting today. I've added a
message board to the Key Club site. I have to change the color scheme, though.




Well, I have lots of work to do and lots of sleep to get. I'll post again
tomorrow, probably.




P.S. Read my poem in Spanish today. It went well. People laughed. I wore a
fedora and sunglasses. Life is good (almost).
