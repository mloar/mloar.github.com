Ah, normalcy. I also scored an 884 on the ChemTest.




Well, let's see. I got up early to go to the NHS meeting. We had a yearbook
picture retake. Chemistry was OK, we watched a film on Shakespeare in English,
Mr. Avery took over in CBE, Calculus quiz was evil, Comp Prog put me to sleep
(again), Auto was the usual, though Andy wasn't there, and Econ was same-old,
same-old. I had scholastic bowl practice after school, I have to go to church
tonight, and I have about 5 million things I have to do this week.




On another note, I'm not sure if Mrs. Marcyniuk has faxed that thing yet.
GRRRRRR!!! I'll have to bug her tomorrow. I also have a scholastic bowl meet
tomorrow. Yay. Wish me luck.




Also, I want a four-port USB hub for Christmas. I doesn't need to be powered.
I don't know that I have anywhere left to plug stuff in.
