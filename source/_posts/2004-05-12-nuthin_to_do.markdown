Look how much I've been blogging lately. Tells you something about how much
work I have to do.




I am currently in a state of Grrrrr because the ACH I put in at 3 AM yesterday
hasn't cleared. Plus, I paid for something with my debit card today, so I
can't withdraw the $85 hitting the red. Hmmm, I wonder how much is in my
wallet? Not enough. Grrrrrr.
