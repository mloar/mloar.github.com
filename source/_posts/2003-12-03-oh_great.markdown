Well, I called MIT today, and you know what they said? They said that it
probably got lost in the mail, and I should have Mrs. M send it by fax. Now
they tell me.




Anyway, Chris is over, and we're doing Chemistry. I put off retaking the calc
test until tomorrow. Also, the chem test has been pushed back to Thursday.




This story will be updated as additional information becomes available.
