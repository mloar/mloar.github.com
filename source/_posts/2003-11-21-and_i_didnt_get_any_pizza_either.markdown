Well, the Membership Drive went well. The only new people attending were two
people Kyle brought with him, and they weren't very interested in the meeting.
At least Mary ditched English and came to the meeting. That was cool.




I was late to Econ today because Mr. Elliott got mad about his tools again. I
don't know if he should be allowed to teach Auto 10\.




I actually stayed awake in Chemistry today. I had another Grade Lowering
Opportunity in English.




Taught ourselves differential equations and indefinite integrals today,
because Mrs. Butler wasn't there. Petey and I almost finished the 6.1
assignment, so I'm thinking that we should just do this every day. Well, she
does have to explain slope charts, because nobody got them, but otherwise it
was good.




Still no work in Comp Prog. Mrs. Dickow keeps giving the sub instructions to
have us write down any problems or obstacles we have, but Josh won't let me
put down "Nothing to do."




MIT processed my SAT II scores today, but still hasn't processed Mrs.
Marcyniuk's recommendation. I checked with her, and she says she sent it, so I
hope they take care of it tomorrow.




Romeo and Juliet opens tonight. Play people say it sucks. I'm going to see it
Saturday night.




Board actually accomplished stuff today. We approved the point system,
accepted Student Council's donation of cash toward the deficit of cans, and
struck two members from the roster who said they aren't coming back. I envy
the presidents of Civitas and NHS. All of their members are well-behaved. We
get the people who talk through meetings. I can't exactly scold them, because
there are too few members already. Sigh...
