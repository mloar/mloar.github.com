I was learning about Firefox extensions today, and I happened upon this. Look
at the XML NameSpec URL:




<window class="dialog"




title="CovertProxy - About"




orient="vertical"




autostretch="always"




onload="sizeToContent()"




xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"\>




It took me a while to figure it out, but that's pretty clever, and REALLY
nerdy.
