Hello. I just got back from my sister's house. I'm talking to Mary. No
fascinating revelations tonight. Dang, it's 10:30 already. Tomorrow I have to
finish all my homework, in addition to a million other things. Aw shucks!
Apparently, the Key Club trip to Lexington did not go well. That reminds me, I
should work on the Key Club site. Sorry, another boring post tonight. But my
life is boring. Sigh...well, here's something. Jen asked me to Turnabout. That
good enough?
