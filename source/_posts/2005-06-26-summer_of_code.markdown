Guess what?




I got accepted for the Google Summer of Code!




That means that I write a module for [Drupal][0], and Google gives me $4500\.
Cool, huh?




Anyway, I've been working with VHCS on my Linode, and it's going to take a lot
of work to get ready for prime time. This is making me rethink moving all of
the accounts over. However, if I don't use it to replace my reseller account,
I need to find some lucrative purpose for it, since it is costing SamAMac
money.




Well, I'm tired. I'd love to chat tomorrow if anybody feels like calling.
