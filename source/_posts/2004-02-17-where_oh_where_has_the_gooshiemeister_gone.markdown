Hey, everybody. I know I haven't blogged in a while. I've been real busy.




For anyone who doesn't yet know, I had my appendix removed one week ago today.
And I feel fine. I went back to school on Friday and am now buried under a
mountain of make-up work. Well, not actually, but kinda. This sucks.




I have the Scholastic Bowl Conference (or is it regionals? I can never
remember) meet tomorrow. Then Wednesday I have a field trip downtown to see
the Moliere Comedies. Joy!




Trying to decide whether to take the Calc test tomorrow. I figure I'll fail it
whether I take it tomorrow or not. Shucks.




Well, I got to go. I got plenty o' work to do.




BTW, some dude in Nashville paid for a Platinum account. Yay!
