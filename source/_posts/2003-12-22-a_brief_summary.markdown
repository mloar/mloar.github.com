So, Friday:




-Went to receive instructions from Father Damien after school.




-Abbie missed her flight, so I was planning on going at midnight to get her,
but then Hank called and asked if I wanted to see Lord of the Rings. We saw
it, and then I went back to Woodstock with him to wait for Abbie. It ended up
being awhile.




Saturday:




-MIT deferred me.




-Went to my sister's for party and gift exchange. Got two new Bond novels.
Rock on!




-Discovered that I cannot do automated signups with my reseller account. Now
bummed, because I'm working on getting automated domain registrations with my
new domain reseller account. I can even sell web hosting through the new
account, but I don't like it as much.




Sunday:




-Tried to go caroling with NHS, but nobody else was there. According to
Bonnie, it was canceled because nobody was interested. Oh well.




-Check out the Italian Ghetto.




-Trying to find a good use for my time.
