Well, I haven't blogged in a long time. Here's what's been going on:




The Battle of the Bands was Thursday. It was a big success. Lots of people
came. Brian was the MC, and he did a great job. We raised about $900\. Kyle
tried to steal the show, but oh well. It's going to be our single service
project this year. Afterward a bunch of us went to Denny's. That was fun,
especially when I showed Renee that I can go from Bill Murray to Kevin Bacon
in three steps.




Then yesterday, I was supposed to take the bloody Mensa test, but they
wouldn't let me because I wasn't 18 yet. So I decided to go to the Salute to
the 60's concert instead. Renee was babysitting, which was a bummer because
she's a big oldies fan. I actually called Bonnie on the off chance she would
want to go, but she was spending time with her cousin. Mary went with me
though, and we had a great time, as great a time to be had in Merrillville,
Indiana. The Grass Roots, the Buckinghams, and Herman's Hermits were there.
Afterward we went to...Denny's!




Today I had to do the usual mopping and serve Mass. Oh well. Anyway, I
discovered that I had grabbed my Econ book instead of my Calc book, so right
now I'm doing random Key Club and other stuff while listening to my new
autographed Herman's Hermits CD.




Wednesday is my birthday. Thursday is an early dismissal. Life is good.
