This release corrects a couple of problems with the first version of afsbak.
Firstly it removes the -omitdirs argument to vos dump. I hadn't realized that
only looks at the mtime and ctime on the directory, so it will miss updates to
existing files. Secondly I now filter what is written to stderr, since BackupPC
doesn't like things it doesn't recognize being written to stderr.




You can find it at the [afsbak][0] page.
