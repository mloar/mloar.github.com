I heard a strange noise a little while ago, and it took me a while to figure out
what it was:

How in the world did it freeze in the _refrigerator_? I can only guess that
it is because it was sitting under the vent, as the bottle next to it is still
liquid. The sad thing is I don't even like Perrier. I only have it because
Safeway.com was giving it away as a promotion. It has been in there for like a
year.




Anyway, I'm finally back to a sane sleep schedule and I'm not going to ruin it
for this. Those green glass shards can wait for morning.
