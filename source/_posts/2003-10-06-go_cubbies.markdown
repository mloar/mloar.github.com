The Cubbies just won the division series! Woohoo!!!




BTW, WB won at Homecoming against York, 31-7\. Rock on!




Doing calc and a million other things which will conspire to depress me and my
grades.




Yesterday my siblings came to the house and we worked on renovating the
kitchen. Now it's all yellow. Dad's already tearing up the floor.




They nearly finished the street last week, so hopefully it will be done by
next weekend, if I survive to see next weekend. Woohoo! Three-day weekend!
Unfortunately, I have to take the SAT Saturday morning and miss RTC, then
Kyle's birthday party, then I have to interview with this guy from Olin on
Sunday. Fun times ahead! Thankfully, Mary has volunteered to call that MIT
guy. Thank you, Mary!




I just remembered that whole Kiwanis liability insurance thing. I'm wondering
if we could somehow use it to wiggle out of these silly permission forms,
since the administration doesn't seem to care about any of the other don't
-have-blanket-liability-insurance-through-Kiwanis-International clubs doing
whatever they want.




Have to walk to NHS tomorrow. Joy!




Oh yeah, guess who was Homecoming King? I'll give you a hint: after being
crowned, he did the chicken walk at the behest of the football team.




I have to leave! There's something wrong with my duck!
