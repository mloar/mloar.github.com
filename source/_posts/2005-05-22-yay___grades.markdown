Yeah, so I got my grades tonight.




Well, I passed all of my classes and I'm not on academic probation. Other than
that, I can' t be too upbeat.




I feel my grade in CS 231 was ridiculous. I did darn well in that class.




My dismal performance notwithstanding, somebody needs to explain to my mother
the difference between U of I and Bradley.
