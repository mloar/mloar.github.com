Ah, the joys of high school.




Tomorrow I shall be required to write an in-class essay on _A Farewell to
Arms_. I hate writing in-class essays, especially on things I really don't
like. I can never finish them in time, and I actually have to _write_ them. I
like taking a day to type an essay, and using the thesaurus built into my word
processor. I also have a pre-calc test on polar coordinates and vectors. Let's
see if I can break my own record for screwing up a test on something I
actually know.




On a lighter note, I now have a suit for Turnabout. I think I'm all set for
Saturday now. Life is OK and getting better.




I intended to blog about all the depressing things that happened today, but it
seems pointless now. Besides, I only have 8 minutes left to finish my
statistics homework before MacGyver comes on. Au revoir!
