Yay, Halloween. On a Friday. The night before I have to take the SAT II. Joy.
Anyone up for bowling or something? Seriously, if you read this on Friday
night and feel like doing something, call me. I don't really care that the
stupid test is tomorrow, because Saturday night is already shot. Father Damien
called this morning and asked if I could help out at the Spaghetti Dinner.
Yay. I was up early this morning writing my English paper. Then I had to write
my Econ paper during the day at school. It sucked. Some of my teachers have
worse time-management skills than I do. Yeah.




Key Club kinda sucked yesterday. I'm working on online stuff to try to get the
board organized, now that I have a miniscule little weekend to take a bit of a
breather.




Food Drive not doing so well so far.
