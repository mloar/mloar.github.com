Roomie is in the room, watching TV, with the light off.




No problem, right? I can just go to the lounge to study. Except that the door
to the lounge is locked.




Well, there's my refuge in the pressing room. But that's locked too.




So now I'm down in the main lounge, trying to study with a bunch of people
watching the TV and talking.




UPDATE: OK, these two guys walked in and asked me to do a survey on sales
taxes. When I was done, everyone had left and I was able to turn off the TV.
So I'm all right now, but I'm still a little angry, and I think I might email
the RA and ask about this.
