Well, I only spent about 2 hours tonight working on a single SQL query for the
Key Club database. I don't mind, though. Well, I'm going to hurriedly finish
my chemistry (due tomorrow? who knows?) and then off to bed (well, a little
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle will likely precede that, but yeah). Actually, I was
immensely happy because last night I came upon a vocab word in my recreational
reading and I was like, "Yes! It's all worth it now!" I do like vocab, though.
It's fun to use words like eleemosynary (if you can spell them without
spellcheck, that is!). I have to stop hanging out with Chris so much. I'm
starting to use his little mispronunciations without realizing it.




Oh, here's a little tidbit. I tried to call the MIT alum to schedule and
interview, but I got some very thrilled person on the phone who said he
wouldn't be home until "at least 8" and that she didn't think that he did
interviews anymore. Yay for me. Now I don't want to call back, but I can't
just not call back, either. This sucks.




Well, we'll see if I can survive another week of this.
