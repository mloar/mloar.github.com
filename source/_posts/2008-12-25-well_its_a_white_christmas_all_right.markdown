Followup to yesterday:
[Sand on roads worse than salt, scientists say][0] - look for the quote from the guy in Mchenry County, IL. Ironically, that's where my parents live and where I might have gone for the holidays.




It has finally gotten above freezing here, and so we're getting some rain. But it's supposed to drop below freezing tonight, and the NWS is predicting snow for tomorrow. But they also have a statement that Friday and Saturday will see a return to normal temperatures and rain, which will likely result in flooding. What fun!




Oh well. Merry Christmas!
