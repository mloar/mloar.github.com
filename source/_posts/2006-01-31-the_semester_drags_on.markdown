So today I received the tape drive and SCSI card I ordered for myself.
However, when I installed the SCSI card, my NIC stopped working. I removed the
SCSI card. NIC still didn't work. Not good. I ended up disabling the onboard
NIC and obtaining a replacement NIC from ACM. However, I am concerned that
this failure could cascade to the rest of the motherboard.




I am currently working on a diabolically evil CS 421 MP. It is due at 11:59
AM. I have class at 8:30, and then I'm going to miss part of my other class
because I am scheduled to have lunch with the Chancellor. He wants to meet
with officers of service organizations for some reason. Whatever.




I just changed my Windows color scheme so it's all freaky looking. It's
awesome.
