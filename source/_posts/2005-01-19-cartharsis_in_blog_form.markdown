OK, so Go Daddy raised their registration fees, right? And so I wanted to
transfer the domains I run for customers of SamAMac, right? And I had it all
worked out that I was going to transfer them to eNom, right? But then I
transferred them to 007Names instead because it's cheaper, right? And then I'm
like, but I can't pay 007Names because I don't have my stupid Checkcard,
right?




Right?
