Maureen used my Verse of the Week! Yay!




Anyway, my birthday, as you know, was the 28th. I still need to get my debit
card from my bank. I was looking at this Cingular plan the other day. I've
determined that Mom's phone isn't good enough for several reasons, namely:



    
*   
    
    Sprint PCS sucks. "All digital, all PCS," all crap.
    
    
*   
    
    I can't give the number out.
    
    
    





Anyway, Cingular's cheapest plan is $19.99/month, which I think is pretty
affordable. I can get a Nokia 3595 for free (with a 2-year commitment, of
course). I don't know, it just would be a lot more convenient for me to have a
way to reach Mom when both of us are out, considering I don't have a car. Plus
once I get my investment account transferred, I'll be saving $7/month.




I don't know. But I have to get to bed, so whatever.
