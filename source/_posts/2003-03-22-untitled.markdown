Oh, forgotten blog! Well, I'm back. It's Friday, I'm tired. But I'll post a
little.




Flower sale was today. We had a lot left over. They were all dying because
nobody knew we were supposed to cut them yesterday. Oh well.




Yesterday, I got to hold hands with Zeljka and Josie. OK, before you go off on
me, it was because we were performing a physics experiment (I love physics).
But it was still cool, considering.




BTW, the best way to deal with Chris is to ignore him or hit him. I _usually_
opt for the former.
