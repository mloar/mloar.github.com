Oh boy.




So it started at 9:30 with my Econ midterm. That was OK, I guess. I just
checked the answer to the free response section, and I got some of it wrong.
I'm not sure exactly how much.




Then Diff Eq at 2\. That absolutely sucked. There is a strong positive
correlation between being a math professor and being a total jerk.




Then I had to finish my CS 231 homework by 5\. I picked up the last assignment,
and I got a 100%.




Then Physics at 7\. That wasn't too bad.




I topped it off with an Old-Fashioned Shake at Moonstruck.




Because of my exams, there is no physics lab or diff eq homework this week. So
I'm pretty much done at 1 tomorrow. I have a job at 2 PM.




So right now, I'm watching Animal House. Beauty.




Also, I'm thinking of moving my blog.
