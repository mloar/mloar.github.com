From _Computer Security_ by Matt Bishop, the text for CS 498sh:




"**Theorem 3-4\.** \[450\] For protection systems without the **create**
primitives, the question of safety is complete in **P-SPACE**."




That's a good example of what the book contains. I will grant that protection
models are a worthy topic in a computer security class, but the sort of
pedantic mathematical definitions of "safety" and "security" that they have in
this book I find pointless. This is just the kind of thing that ivory-tower
academics discuss while the department they work for leaks students' social
security numbers.
