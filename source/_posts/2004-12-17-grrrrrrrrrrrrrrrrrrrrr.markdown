I overslept and missed the ITAB meeting. Grrr. Grrr. Grrr.




Actually, I didn't oversleep. I woke up 5 minutes before my alarm was supposed
to go off. But then I fell asleep again.




Anyway, I have a final at 7 tonight and one at 8 tomorrow morning.




Also, I just found out the Microsoft scholarship app requires a letter of
recommendation. Who could I ask? Though you know, I don't think it really
matters, since I don't think they'd award it to me after a whole semester.
