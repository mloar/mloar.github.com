Well, my attempt to set myself on a good sleep schedule for school has met
with some degree of success. I went to bed at 6:30 last night and got up at
3:30 this morning. Just 5 hours before I had to be in class.




So I went to my first class of the new semester, ECON 411: Public Sector
Economics. When the instructor came in, I thought "Awesome! He speaks perfect
English!" Then he told us he was just filling in for our real professor, Prof.
Giertz. Hmm, Giertz. Sounds German. I hope he speaks good English.




Anyway, after we got a syllabus and filled out a questionaire to confirm we
met the prerequisites for this class, we got out. I now have 3 hours until my
next class. I'm thinking I should go to the mall and buy a new belt. My old
one broke yesterday, and I was wearing my good one this morning, but it won't
do. It's too wide for my phone holster. I think I'll get a new umbrella, too.
It's raining and my old one is crap.




Well, I hope you enjoyed my first post in a looooooooooooong time. I'm
thinking about replacing the theme of my blog so it's not the stupid WordPress
default. But no promises.
