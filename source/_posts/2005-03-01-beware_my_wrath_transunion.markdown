OK, so after being told I'd have to jump through the same hoops to get my
annual credit reports from Experian and Equifax that I did to get my
TransUnion one, I've decided I'm just going to call them tomorrow, tell them
what morons they are, and make them fix it once and for all.




Idiots.




In other news, the CS 231 exam went pretty well. Diff eq is as confusing as
ever. And tonight I went to see Anderson Cooper (the CNN guy) talk at
Foellinger. It was pretty cool. I gave up trying to contact my first client
for work and cancelled the ticket. Hopefully I'll get another one soon, I need
to get some work.




DCON is this weekend. Fun fun. Yeah, and not only does our club not have a
treasurer, I don't think our division has an LTG either. And while I may end
up being treasurer in addition to secretary, the Bylaws prohibit a club
officer from being LTG. We had an argument at yesterday's board meeting over
whether this was the rule in Key Club too or not. Mary?




Beware, TransUnion!
