This week is going to seriously suck. Not only do I have the usual two
assignments due Wednesday morning, but I also have a midterm for CS 498sh on
Wednesday morning. I haven't been to that class since the first day, though I
was watching the lecture videos last night, and I was very glad that I had not
gone to class since the first day, since the lectures were tedious and
useless.




I can't wait to get out of here. Every day it becomes more painfully apparent
that this supposedly top-tier engineering school is a bastion of incompetence
and financial mismanagement. From professors who don't know anything about the
subject matter to IT officials clueless about basic security concepts to an 80
-million-dollar building where the thermostats don't work, I wonder every day
how it is U of I manages to stay at the top of the charts. My guess is it's
self-fulfilling. The high ranking attracts the brightest students, the
brightest students succeed despite the poor quality of instruction, and get
the best positions in research and industry, perpetuating the myth that this
school is a nexus of exceptional teaching.




Anyway, I just got an email from Microsoft saying that they have processed my
reimbursement and I should receive it soon. Yay!
