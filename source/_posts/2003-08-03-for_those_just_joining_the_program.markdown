If you haven't figured it out already, I've been posting a lot of links lifted
off of [Dave Barry's Blog][0]. Why? Because I'm too lazy to write about my own
stupid life. Not that there's anything to write about. BTW, the new Key Club
site is up.




P.S. Check [this][1] out! WARNING: Contains some disgusting content. Viewer
discretion advised.
