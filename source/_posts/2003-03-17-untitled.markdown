And now for my side:




1) I gave her the choice: Chicago or Deerfield? I'm sure I could have found
the one in Deerfield a lot easier. Besides, I got lost in Chicago. I was with
Jennifer when she got lost in Wheaton.




2) As for not getting on the list, join me in your best Han Solo impression:
"It's not my fault!!!"




Ed Debevic's was fun. And Jennifer enjoyed it, don't let her persuade you
otherwise.
