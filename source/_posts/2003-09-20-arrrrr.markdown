Totally forgot about Talk Like a Pirate Day until I was in programming today.
I actually didn't do anything in programming today, just surfed the web. It's
so nice to know more than anybody, especially Kevin Franzen.




Watched _The Cable Guy_ tonight. Now I have a whole new arsenal of crazy
quotes.




Our little presentation in English went pretty well. I slept through chemistry
and calculus, though.




I considered going to the football game tonight, but I didn't because I slept
all evening. Because of the whole fiasco at AT, almost their entire varsity
team was out, so we better have won. I finally got my dresser, though.




I've had a sore throat all day. I hope I'm not getting sick. I'm going to
sleep all weekend, just in case. Oh, how I wish I could. But I have all of
this wonderful homework and college applications and Key Club stuff to do, so
I can't. Bummer.




I have to do two weeks of personal journals for Mr. Blair. I guess I'll just
get last week's from what I posted to my blog. Joy.




Watch for flurries of craziness with a 30% chance of total insanity.




Come, Watson. It's time for another grand adventure. The more I read Brit Lit,
the more I realize that I should have taken French.




Buenas noches!
