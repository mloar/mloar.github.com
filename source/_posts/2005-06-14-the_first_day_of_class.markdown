Yay.




Well, let's see how my day went:




8:40 - wake up to make my 9 AM class




9:00 - get to CS 273\. The instructor seems pretty cool, but it is boring and
I'm already lost. I hate discrete mathematics. Scratch that - I hate ALL
mathematics. Except stats. Maybe.




10:15 - come back to the dorm. Almost immediately, I get a ticket. Professor
Emeritus. Computer won't boot. Yay. I call and set up the appointment with his
wife. Exactly two hours later, I get a call from the OnSite dispatcher. Upon
suggestion by my boss, she had called the prof and asked him if he left a disk
in the drive again. Turns out he had. I wonder what the story there is.




4:30 - went to release a book in the Siebel Center. On the way out, I checked
my ACM office access, and it worked! Yay!




5:00 - trip to Walgreens to buy Diet Coke. On sale for $2.50\. Sweet!




And thus continues my horribly pathetic life.




In other news, I'm making good progress on my spyware-blocking application.
