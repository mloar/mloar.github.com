Holiday Embrace was great. They actually hired a DJ that played music you
could dance to. Dinner was excellent, and the threatened snow didn't appear
until after we had arrived home. That was the most fun I have had in a very
long time.




Today I had to get up early to go mop the floor at church. Then I had to come
home, eat breakfast, change, go to church, mop again, come home, shovel, and
then delve into my homework. I'm almost set for tomorrow, but I didn't finish
nearly as much as I wanted to over the two weeks. Oh well.
