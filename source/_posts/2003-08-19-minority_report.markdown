Cougars won 3-2\. Go Cougars.




Didn't see any Key Clubbers, but did see a Wheaton Kiwanian. Apparently, Glen
Ellyn and Elmhurst were there too.




The parking lot still sucks, but at least it's free.




Realized I never got my ID back at registration. Must remedy this tomorrow.
Also never got an assignment notebook.




Boston report can wait one more day. I'm tired.




Eleventh-hour appeal: any Key Clubbers who are able should come help out at
freshman registration, or else.




Buenas noches.
