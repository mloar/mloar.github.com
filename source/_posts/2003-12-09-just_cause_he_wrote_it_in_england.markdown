OK, here's a funny story:




A while back, Chris told me that Mr. Shanahan had pointed out that a lot of
elements from _Hamlet_ ended up in _Strange Brew_. The more I learn about
_Hamlet_ (I can't wait till we read it), the more I realize its true: Pam's
uncle kills her father and marries her mother, her father appears as a ghost,
the brewery is called "Elsinore Brewery" and is located next to "Elsinore
Castle."




OK, well tonight I was looking around for the Bob and Doug McKenzie version of
"The 12 Days of Christmas," which is from their album, _Great White North._
Well, I found a site that not only had their album, but also the Strange Brew
soundtrack, which apparently didn't sell well and was only available for a
short time in 1983\. Well, one of the tracks on it was titled, "Shakespeare
Horked Our Script," and involved the two of them debating whether they stole
from Shakespeare or Shakespeare stole from them. It was hilarious.




Oh, and I want a copy of _Strange Brew_ on DVD and a _Great White North_ CD
for Christmas.
