OK, so I got my calc exam back today, and I bombed it. And then my TA told us
that this isn't one of those classes where lecture notes are sufficient,
because there isn't enough time in lecture to cover everything. That's funny,
because it seems like there's always time in lecture to do things like prove
the Pythagorean Theorem, which isn't on the exam. Also, I know people in the
same situation as me in that they get perfect scores on the quizzes and then
failed the exam. And the one guy was in Dror's discussion, and took Dror's
quizzes. Funny.
