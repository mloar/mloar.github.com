Tonight I finished moving what I've been calling SamAMacNet from [tinc][0] to
[OpenVPN][1]. Basically, I just need a way to use SMB to back up my laptop and
parents' computer with [backuppc][2].




I had been using tinc, which is designed to be a "mesh routing" VPN - it does
not require a star topology where clients connect to a central server that
routes all of the traffic. Instead, each node forms links to other nodes and
routes traffic. You generate public/private keys for each node, distributing
the public keys to the other nodes to which you wish to connect.




However, there are [lingering questions][3] about how secure tinc is. I also
encountered a problem running tinc with NAT on both ends - even if the packets
are routed correctly, it doesn't like it if the port numbers are modified in
transit. As a result, I had to run tinc in TCP mode - definitely suboptimal.




OpenVPN, on the other hand, appears to have been designed around sound
cryptographic principles. I also am able to run it in UDP mode with no
problems. Plus, the inclusion of a DHCP server makes OpenVPN a much better fit
for the "roadwarrior" scenario, which is how I intend to use it on my laptop.
