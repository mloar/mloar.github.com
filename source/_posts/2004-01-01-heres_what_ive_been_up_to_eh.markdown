YESTERDAY:




Finished Macbeth. Got a lot of cleaning done in the recroom. Dad told me Mom
told him explicitly not to touch the recroom. I am so dead. But at least the
place is cleaner, eh?




TODAY:




Drove out to Grandma's to drop off Aunt Phyllis' car. Then Chris and I got
together to do Chemistry. Got very little done. Finally got agenda for board
meeting emailed to people. Board meeting at Aurelio's again. Chris stayed for
dinner, and then we watched Strange Brew. Chris fell asleep. Chris initially
planned to come to Mass with Dad and me, but decided not to on account of his
sleepiness. Bummer. I kind of would like to do something besides go to Mass,
given that I'm not scheduled to serve, but oh well. Too late now. I'm going to
finish the recroom and get ready. Chris and I are planning a sleepover for
tomorrow night to get lots o' work done.




Ciao!
