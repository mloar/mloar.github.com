[Your Big Five Results][0]: [I'm a O16-C52-E9-A50-N94 Big Five!!][0]




Today was an OK day. Nothing much happened till lunch, when I got up and sang
"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter." It wasn't quite as well-received
as "I'm Into Something Good," but it was OK. Chris shouted "YOU SUCK!!!"
really loud, and then one of the lunchroom supervisors bawled him out. It was
great.




Key Club went all right. There's so much to do, but the committees are working
pretty well. I like Mr. Verthein's suggestion of breaking into committees
every week, it seems like that would be a good idea. At least he seems like
he's letting me do my job more. I was afraid for a while that he would take
over everything. I've never been a very authoritarian person, and he seemed
all to eager to take over, but I'm probably reading too much into it. All I
know is that this meeting went better, and based on how many people wanted to
talk to me at the same time, I'm in control.
