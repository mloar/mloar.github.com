Today was a pretty good day. I went to Cosley Zoo with my family earlier, then
I went with my sister Abbie to the airport. The really weird thing just
happened now after I got back. Out of the blue, Ryan Olson from Young Pups
IM's me and tells me that he found the quiz I put on Quizilla and liked it.
I'm like star struck now. Coolness!
