I write this from the sound booth of the Rendezvous, a bar with a "jewel box theater" in the back. It's my sister's boyfriend's 40th birthday, and since he is a musician, what better way to celebrate than to rent the Rendezvous and have a musical bash with all of his musician friends. My sister has a surprise planned for the end of the evening, and so I am up in the sound booth to play PowerPoint jockey.




This weekend is just full of excitement. Tomorrow I have the holiday party for work, where "semi-formal" was qualified with "don't feel you need a suit or anything." Then Sunday I am going to a party that Clayton (and someone named Zoe, who I presume is his girlfriend or something) is holding. That's kind of cool, I haven't talked to him since I got out here again. Or Keith, for that matter. I ponder whether Keith might be there as well.




Anyway, so full weekend. Which is good, because I have had a very busy week at work, and it's only going to get worse. At least I'm coding again, so I'm having fun.




Well, the show is getting started. Time to get off.
