I'm making a post here - HUGE SUCCESS.




Wow, it has been four months since my last post. Let's see what I have to report.




Work has been fairly slow, though it's starting to pick up now. There's a big reorg to prepare for the next release going on at the moment. Luckily I get to stay with my current manager and work on more-or-less the same feature team. However that feature team is moving to a different department, so our priorities going forward will likely be quite different. Right now I'm knee-deep in trying to port all of the clients of a clunky old API to the shiny new API so that we can kill the clunky old API which we currently share responsiblity for with another feature team which is going to a different department. Fun stuff.




In July I took a vacation to San Francisco. Mostly I explored the public transit system. I rode BART from SFO to my hotel just off Market Street. While I was there I rode the Muni Metro out to the zoo and saw their interesting mixed-traffic LRV operation. I also took Muni to AT&T park to catch a Giants afternoon game for which I got box seats. On Saturday I met a bunch of ACM people for lunch at a little French bistro, and then that evening I took BART over to Berkeley to see a Death Cab for Cutie concert (oh, the irony!). All-in-all it was a fun trip.




I did finally call an interior decorator to pick colors for me, and I'm glad I did. I really like the two colors she selected for my living room (Benjamin Moore colors "Atmospheric" and "Glacial Till"). She also selected colors for the rest of my place, but so far I have only painted the living room. I also bought a desk for my living room, and I bought some posters at a place in San Francisco and had them mounted on foam and shipped home.




In July the new light rail opened. I actually was at Westlake Center at 0945 to get on one of the first trains, which gives you some idea of how excited I was about this. It's really nice, and it will be even better once it reaches the airport in December. I can't wait for the future expansions.




I'm thinking about getting a new computer. The keyboard on the Thinkpad is starting to give me trouble, and it spends its life on my desk anyway, so I think I should get a desktop. Preferably one with a good graphics card so I can play my Steam games at home instead of on my ridiculously-good-for-gaming work machine. I've played through the entire Half-Life 2 series. I've been trying to work my way through Half-Life: Source mostly to learn the backstory for HL2, but I got stuck at one point and haven't been at it for a while. Speaking of which, if you like Half-Life, you should check out [Freeman's Mind][0]. It's really funny.




Well, I think that's enough for now. Hopefully I'll post more frequently in the future.
