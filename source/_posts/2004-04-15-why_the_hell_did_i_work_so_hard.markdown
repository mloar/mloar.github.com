I'm not getting any money from the VP Bank. Bonnie took first place, somebody
from York was second, and Niemet was third. So screw the dinner.




I have come to the realization that all the hard work I've put in the last
four years has gotten me nowhere. I didn't need 5 AP classes or a 4.667 GPA or
a 1500 on the SAT to get into U of I. Apparently, 4 years in Key Club and on
the Scholastic Bowl Team and the Science Honor Society and 2 years in NHS and
Civitas doesn't make me qualified enough to get any scholarships.
