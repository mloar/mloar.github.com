I am hereby boycotting any and all other works by ANY of the BrontÃ«s.




I have to finish reading it, and then do the journals for both works. At least
the journals won't be too difficult, once I actually sit down and do them.




If I read the chemistry assignment correctly, it's not due right away, but I
still want to finish chapter 3 and tidy up the first two.




I am determined not to be mad for putting it off, since:




1) I didn't actually put it all off until now, just one lousy book, the
journals, and 1.75 chapters of chemistry.




2) I object to summer homework on principle.




I'm considering writing a satirical romance novel, using the same language but
with a modern setting. I think I'll do that once I'm done writing my operating
system.
