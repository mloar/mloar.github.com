I won the Judge's Prize!




Judge's Prize:The Judges' Prize is to be awarded, not on the basis of the
competition, but solely at the whim and discretion of the judges. Novel
algorithms, interesting implementations, beautiful code, arresting user
interfaces, use of parallelism -- these things may well count for something in
the judges' eyes. The team winning the Judges' Prize will be awarded




\*\* Money:$1000




\*\* Wisdom:Each member of the team will receive autographed copies of faculty-
authored texts in computer science.



    
*   
    
    Recognition:Winning team members will be acknowledged during the
    presentation of the awards and on the department's website as a group of
    "extremely cool hackers."
