And you thought California judges were dumb.

Yay, more authority for the FCC. It's not like the FCC charges $75 for
licenses for the "General Mobile Radio Service" or anything.




Today went pretty well. The chem lab went all right, I got my English homework
done (Yay, Major Works Data Sheets. It's not like I have anything better to do
than spend several hours filling out one of these stupid things for everything
we read so Mr. Blair won't give me an F on it because I didn't fill every
square inch) and tomorrow we're watching the video of the Springer skit. It
should be funny.




I got my lunchbox back! I lost it yesterday, but today it was sitting on the
filing cabinet in the cafeteria. Yay!




I almost asked Lindsey B. to Homecoming. Almost.




Well, I have a ton of stuff to do to get ready for Key Club tomorrow. Key Club
101, yay!




Oh, and another thing. Mr. Verthein came into my English class today to talk
to me because he couldn't get into contact with the lady running Good Neighbor
Day to find out where we would be for administrative approval, and he said he
was considering canceling the activity. The administration sucks. If we don't
get to do this because of them and miss our press coverage, then an anonymous
narrative of my experience caroling for NHS last year will find its way into
Mr. Johnson's inbox.




**Currently listening to: Man, it's so loud in here by They Might Be Giants**




Rock on.




P.S. Oh, yes! Good news, good news! I got my letter from MIT today. They also
sent me another application, which is good, since Mrs. Brown told us that we
should have two. It's been a good day.




Plus, tonight is the West Wing premiere, in addition to Enterprise and Joe
2.0, a show which kind of looks interesting. But duty calls, and I must post
this entry. Au revoir!
