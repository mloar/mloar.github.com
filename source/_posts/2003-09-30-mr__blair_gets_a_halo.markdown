Guess what? After the exalted Josie had her conference with Mr. Blair (he's
making all of us do them, she was first), Mr. Blair realized that he had "been
working our asses off" and that he was going to take it down a notch. When he
said this, Vince turned to Josie and said, "I love you, Josie!" That's a
sentiment I share. All hail Josie! (Incidentally, it took me about 15 minutes
to realize that Mr. Blair had actually said "asses.")




Then in Calculus, Mrs. Butler told us that tomorrow would be a "work day."
Things just keep getting better and better!




Econ went well, as well as the Scholastic Bowl practice. Mrs. Joyce pretty
much said that I would be the captain, so I'm happy.




Well, I do have to finish something for English, as well as my National Merit
essay, so I'll sign off now. Check out the "interesting" link!
