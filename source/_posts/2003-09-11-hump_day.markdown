Hey, new features! Something about a draft, and spell check! Coolness.




Got called down to the principal's office today. I'm "88's Best." Rock on.




Rest of the day kind of sucked. Chris is convinced I have ADD.




The Key Club meeting went all right, I guess. I think it looked like we were
totally disorganized. It seems I spent the summer putting all my ducks in a
row, but at the first meeting I forgot my duck.




Check out [Italian Ghetto][0] for two new quotes.




Tomorrow's an early dismissal. I can't wait for this week to be over already.
Heck, I can't wait for the year to be over already.




Back to derivatives.




P.S. Had to record Enterprise, but am now convinced that Gene Roddenberry
would be turning in his grave had he not been cremated and his ashes launched
into space.
