In case you haven't noticed, I just replaced my blog. Say goodbye to Serendipity, and hello to Nanoblogger, the blog software written entirely in Bourne shell. It works rather well, and allows me to do the same sort of offline composition and staging that I use for the other parts of my site.




So it's been a while since I blogged last. A week ago today I went out to dinner on this recruiting thingamajig. Sameer was there, as he was out here interviewing with programming languages teams. I wonder if he got an offer or not. The following night I went out to dinner with him, Chris Eben, Kyle Wilkinson, and half of Kyle's company at an overly-expensive restaurant called La Spiga. Then I ran (literally) home, as my sister Aimee was coming in that night for a job interview on Monday, and staying at my place. We had a pretty good weekend.




This week has been mostly the kind of work that I loathe, but it's coming to an end, and things are slowing down as we enter the holiday season. Today as the bus crawled toward Seattle, the driver got on the microphone and tried to instigate a chorus of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.&quot; When there were no takers, he did so himself, fumbling over the lyrics and singing out of key. It was truly a surreal experience. As he said himself at the end, &quot;That'll either get you into the holiday spirit, or send you over the edge.&quot;
