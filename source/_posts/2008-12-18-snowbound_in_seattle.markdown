So having grown up in the Chicago area, I can't get over the difference in
reaction to snow between Chicago and Seattle. My high school had a reputation
for never closing no matter how much snow came down. During my four years
there, we only had one snow day, and the only reason they closed school that day
was that the district had just purchased this fancy robocall system that could
call all of the parents with a prerecorded message, and so they were just
looking for an excuse to try it out.




Contrast this with Seattle. The forecast called for a couple inches of snow
today. So the Seattle schools were closed. As it turns out, it didn't snow at
all in Seattle (outlying areas did get snow). Now that the forecast calls for
up to three inches (oh, the humanity!), a bunch of other districts have already
cancelled classes, and the verdict is still out on the Seattle schools. Tonight
on the news they had footage of cars and buses (with tire chains, even) getting
stuck in the snow. A lot of people at work live out in North Bend or Duvall and
so don't bother coming to work if there's a hint of snow because they're liable
to end up in a pileup at the bottom of a hill.




It's one thing for say, Houston to shut down when it gets an inch of snow. But from
what I have seen, this isn't exactly a rare occurence. I don't comprehend why
there seems to be such a dearth of snow removal infrastructure in the Puget
Sound Region.
