Yesterday Russ released remctl 2.12, which included my changes to build on Windows. It still didn't quite compile, though, so I have updated my patch with the necessary fixes. He's planning a new release soon, so hopefully after that it will no longer be necessary for me to maintain my patch separately.




You can find my updated patch on the [remctl][0] page.
