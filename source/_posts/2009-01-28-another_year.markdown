Yay 23\.




Interestingly enough after my
[ramblings on PGP and
authentication][0] yesterday, the House decided that my birthday should coincide
with [National Data Privacy
Day][1].




As seen on IRC:


    
    14:50 <@mloar> apparently my birthday will coincide with "National Data Privacy Day" this year
    14:50 <@benley> you should have a gpg keysigning party.
    14:50 <@mloar> haha
    14:50 <@benley> with gin.
    14:50 <@mloar> even better
