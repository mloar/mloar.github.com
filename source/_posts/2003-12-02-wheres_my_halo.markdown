OK, so here's a quick recap of today:




-There was no NHS meeting this morning. I got up early for nothing.




-Mr. Bond-Harris gave an incredibly boring lecture in Programming.




-After school, I had Scholastic Bowl practice. Then Chris picked me up and we
went to his house to play games.




-I had had a headache all day, but it got really bad just as I was about to
come home. I took a Motrin and lay \[I can never remember the stupid lie/lay
rules, is that right?\] down on the couch. Mom woke me up for dinner, but then
I went back and slept until 10:30\. Now I have to do my homework and try to get
some more stuff done.




Oh, yeah, and Mr. V still gets on my nerves. Whoever is president next year
will be SO lucky.
