Today was an OK day. I felt horrible last night, and ended up going to sleep
only to get up at 2 AM and work on a silly history project, which took about
an hour, and then we spent so much time discussing current events in History
that we didn't need them until Monday. Argh! Jen's blog indicates that she is
bored, and I would gladly offer to take her to see Gods and Generals (that is,
if she would want to see that movie, I don't know). It opens today and I
really want to see it, but I have this math competition tomorrow and I'm
really exhausted after this long week, so I'm staying in tonight. I have one
hour to complete my Statement of Eligiblity for Key Club Illinois-Eastern Iowa
District Secretary and get it in the mail. This weekend, I have to finish
reading A Farewell to Arms, journal about the connections, and come up with
some kind of questionaire to introduce the book. Our group has the honor of
going first thing Monday. If you are under the impression that Hemingway was
in any way a competent author, you, my friend, are horribly mistaken.
Fitzgerald, good. Orwell, very good. But Hemingway writes books with undefined
characters and no plot. That is simply inexcusable.
