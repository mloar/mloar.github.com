So today I got something in the mail from the Carpe Diem Foundation. I applied
for a scholarship from them back in February or whenever. Anyway, it said that
I was a semifinalist, but unfortunately, had not gotten any money. They
encouraged me to reapply for next year. I think that "close, but no cigar" is
going to define the rest of my life.




Read somebody's theory on how to make money off of open source today.
Interesting, but it would require me to go ahead with writing my own operating
system from scratch. I think I'll write a bestselling novel first, though.
