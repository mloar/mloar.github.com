Darn it! SimpleHost's free service is down. I'm wondering if it's been
discontinued. Nice of them to warn me if it did. What sucks, though, is that
the upload mechanism was such a pain that I just used their editor to work on
the Italian Ghetto site. Now that it's down, I don't have all of the updated
files. Darn! I had wanted to redesign the site anyway, but now I don't have
all of the stuff I've done already.




On a related note, Go Daddy Software has ended their sale on .us domains. What
do you think, should it be italianghetto.com or italianghetto.us? They also
redesigned their site to make the requisite Hot Blonde Chick even more
prominent. Seriously, any site that has geeks as its target market has a Hot
Blonde Chick on the front page (okay, sometimes it's not a blonde, but there
is ALWAYS a chick).




Darn. I hope I can get to those files.
