Or not.




It's a wonderful 90 degrees here in Seattle. I do not understand this. They
always said that it didn't get hot here. Lies! Lies! The only difference
between here and Illinois is that here, no one has air conditioning. Well,
work does. I may start going to work on the weekends if this heat keeps up.




It occurs to me that I never posted about moving to the U-District. So yeah, I
moved to the U-District. It's a tiny little place, but I'll end up paying next
to nothing to live here, and the location is perfect. Shortly after I moved
here, I discovered that there is a **Jimmy John's** a block-and-a-half away.
How can you possibly beat that?




So anyway, my internship has been going well. I finished the project that they
had anticipated would take me all summer. Now I'm working on a second project
and fixing some bugs. It has been great.




I've also been accepted as the Microsoft Student Ambassador for the coming
year. It's a stupid program, but it has its perks.




I will only have about a week between when I get back to Chicagoland and when
I leave again for school, but I expect to see **everyone** during that week.
Don't think this is an idle threat. I know where you people live.
