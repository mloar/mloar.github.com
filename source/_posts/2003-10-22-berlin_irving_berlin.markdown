We beat York! Their team was entirely freshmen. How about them apples? Then we
lost to Lyons Township, but that's no surprise. We managed to keep the spread
to 300 points.




I made an appointment with the new MIT guy. Yay!




Had to cancel the Key Club meeting this Thursday because of a faculty meeting.
The irony of this is that Allison called me just last night about the PCM she
was planning for Thursday. I told I could meet with her at 3:50 at Glenbard
West, and hung up. Then I realized that I had the club meeting on Thursday, so
I had to call her back. Now I'm debating whether or not to try to set it back
up since I don't have a club meeting anymore. I wonder if Chris would drive me
there. He did think she was hot. I'll ask him tomorrow at our "emergency"
board meeting. Joy.




I have to do calculus now. Then I need to work on my MIT app. Then I need to
work on my English creative writing assignment. We have to tell a part of the
Beowulf epic from the perspective of one of the minor characters. I chose
Wealtheow because I enjoy a challenge. Well, a writing challenge, anyway. I
happen to hate math challenges.




OK, off I go.




Oh yeah, we're watching _With Honors_ in College Bound English. Cool.
