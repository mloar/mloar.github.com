Well, I just installed the new Google Toolbar with BlogThis! built in. It has
a popup blocker too! Rock on!




I just got home at last. I have my certificate from the county. I am now the
proud owner of [SamAMac Communications Company][0]. I'm adding a link from my
blog so that Google will index it.




Well, I'm home at last, and I have much work to do. Later!
