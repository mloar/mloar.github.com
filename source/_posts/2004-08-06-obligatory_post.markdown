Mary keeps telling me that I need to post. But if I post, then I'll feel
obligated to cover everything since my last post, so I don't post, and it just
gets worse.




-July 24: My party. Fun.




-July 31: Renee's party. Fun. Chaz thought I was related to Renee. Weird.




-Aug 1: Going-away/grad party for family. Not fun.




-Aug 2-3: Sick.




-Aug 5: Got oil change. Yay. House now empty. Sucks.




Stay tuned for more exciting adventures.
