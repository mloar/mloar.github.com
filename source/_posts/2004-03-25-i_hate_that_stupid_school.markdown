OK, so here's another rotten story:




Ms. Engel called me today and told me that the administration had finally
found out about the website. They want us to bring it "in-school" for (what
else?) liability reasons. Well, that's just great. Now our site will suck just
like everything else in that school. I'm supposed to meet with the tech person
tomorrow to talk about this.




So what I did is dismantle the Key Club site (I cancelled the SurfXpress
account; I'd been looking for a reason, and now I've got it) and I disabled
the NHS site too. My hope is that Mr. Zaucha will 1) notice, 2) ask why, and
3) wage my battle for me, since he claims to have connections (and seems to be
able to get away with anything). My sister thinks it's a good plan. I should
so be a politician or something.
